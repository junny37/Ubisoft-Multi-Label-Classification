       " 'every year ubisoft montreal releases an assassin’s creed  game and every year they have to address concerns that one year isn ’t long enough to fully flesh out an engaging detailed open world the go -to excuse made by ubisoft pr is that they operate with individual groups of developers and stagger the development cycle in essence they usually have people working on the next game before the previous one is released this is probably at least partially true however it does little to explain how assassin’s creed iv black flag  is narratively and mechanically a blatant reactionary piece to criticisms of 2012 ’s assassin’s creed iii . the previous game which centred on a native american assassin ’s quest for revenge against the backdrop of the american revolutionary war was criticised for taking too long to actually get into the core story and gameplay so black flag  literally opens with you in the midst of a naval battle during a storm and quickly opens up the sandbox to players iii’s protagonist connor drew criticism for being too much of an obnoxious one -dimensional little shit to be in any way entertaining so black flag ’s lead connor ’s grandfather the pirate edward kenway is a roguish fun ne ’er-do-well with no allegiance but his lust for riches most significantly the game ’s setting draws from the sole item of praise many of us had for iii the naval combat moving the entire game from big cities to the high seas is a long shot for a series that despite its staleness more or less stuck to a formula that worked well enough to rake in annual millions and thank god for that the result of this long shot is the best assassin’s creed  to date (at least the best in a fucking long time it doesn ’t play anything like what the franchise traditionally does which is more or less the reason it ’s so good in fact the times when black flag does the standard assassin’s creed  things (tailing people on foot hand -to-hand combat arbitrarily tracking down dozens of icons that do nothing but clutter the map tailing people in a boat are the times when it ’s the least enjoyable (who thought it was a good idea to do stealth sections while still in your ship aside from a new focus on naval combat and boarding enemy ships there are a few extra tools that make the on -foot stealth a lot more palatable than it has been in any previous assassin ’s creed game ‘stalking zones the patches of tall grass and foliage you could use as a hiding spot in assassin’s creed iii  are more abundant in black flag ’s stealth missions and there are extra tools that let you actually take down enemies silently where assassin’s creed iii  would have given you a game over for being spotted black flag  usually just takes away an extra reward that you could have gotten for remaining hidden as a result the assassination missions are actually a lot more fun they ’re still not the sandboxy ‘choose your own adventure missions they pretend to be but they certainly encourage more approaches than previous titles obviously because it ’s assassin’s creed  the best way to approach stealth segments is to not bother and rush in with guns out but this is discouraged through the placement of alarm bells which if rung summon more enemies to join the fight this is a pretty poor deterrent however as the combat is virtually unchanged from assassin’s creed iii , that is to say you can still fight off huge amounts of enemies with no difficulty whatsoever i guess you have to take baby steps when you ’re making one of the most popular franchises in video games with what is presumably one of the highest budgets in video games further dragging down the mood is the return of the modern day framing plot the issue here is of course that series protagonist desmond miles fucking carked it at the end of assassin’s creed iii  in a natural ending to the franchise nobody thought ubisoft would drop the franchise but we were all hoping deep down that they would drop the modern day plot at the very least let it have actual gameplay like most of the previous games more or less did (less). instead black flag  an action game predominantly about a magical pirate treasure hunt is framed by a plot in which you are an office worker searching through a pirates memories to find usable footage for a video game developed by ubisoft in the fucking game universe you ’re pulled out of the action about 4 times to walk around the building of abstergo entertainment (they literally admit it ’s ubisoft in this one and look follow waypoints in super low -fov first person you can optionally leave your animus at any time to search for little sticky notes and other fun collectibles but why the fuck would you nothing that happens in the 2014 portion of this story matters nothing you do in these gameplay sections is fun (you hack into computers by playing frogger the weird bookending is pretty out of place within black flag ’s actual story which essentially plays out like raiders of the lost ark with pirates plus it gets weirdly tangential the hunt for the first civilisation ‘observatory’ works really well with kenway ’s arc wherein his motivation shifts away from selling the location to the highest bidder and towards keeping it out of the hands of the templars represented herein by the real -life governor of havana and his gang of wannabe big brothers there are a few too many tacked on subplots that pander more to pirate tropes (marooned on an island girl dressed as a boy numerous searches for buried treasure than any obligation to the overarching story but it ’s a fun plot with actual characters for once which is more than could be expected black flag is a fun game in a lot of ways the naval world map consists of a couple of major land masses (cuba, jamaica the cayman islands etc with little ports and fishing downs along the coastlines as well as the game ’s least interesting locations the 3 major cities of kingston havana and nassau the weird thing about black flag ’s open world is that it ’s actually close to being as seamless as the e3 presentations made it seem you actually can just hop on and off your ship most of the time there are no loading screens outside the major cities and story missions and most locations have something to do that ’s actually fun having finished all the meaningful content (everything except the random chests and little balls of light it ’s safe to say that black flag is more or less carried by the naval gameplay boarding enemy ships is great jumping from one to the other with all the smoke everywhere is super atmospheric cannons feel powerful and taken down galleons (the game ’s most powerful class of ship is such a great time thanks to the sheer height of the things (you have to

metagame is a weirdly tacked on way to earn extra cash it ’s also tied to your uplay account so if you go for another playthrough you won ’t have to worry about money which ruins the progression system in spite of all the assassin’s creed ishness, black flag  stands up as a competent game that actually makes use of its open world as something that supplements the gameplay instead of the gtav approach of just adding some extra travel between missions above all black flag  injects life and actual enjoyment back into a floundering franchise that ’s basically been treading water since the end

       " \"tldr this is as far as my experiences go the best assassin 's creed game i have ever played or maybe it 's because i have a thing for pirates -themed games i don 't know story is there but certainly not the best part of the game it 's just there because every game needs one it 's the mechanics that works so well and contents that can make you spend 100 hours to complete all things in the game that 's not including the multiplayer (which i haven 't tried the old and tested formula of the ac series is still there but this time there are only 3 huge cities which still looks similar to other cities in the previous ac games and also looks similar to each other the fun part is on the sea it is a seamless experience that is so well implemented that it feels hassle -free and very fun at the same time for an example you can do an assassination side mission then right after you kill the target you can just jump into your ship drives away and wreak havoc shooting every passing ship that passes by naval combat is the highlight of this game for me there are a lot of different types of weapons your typical round shots chain shots mortars heavy shots fire barrels and swivel gun you can choose what to do with an enemy ship destroy it till it sink and get 50 of its cargo or damage it enough to be able to board a ship (kinda like in pokemon lol the boarding is fun too you 'll get different objectives which i think is randomized usually you 'll be told to kill a certain amount of enemies depending on how big that ship is then sometimes you are also given other minor objectives i 'm sure all people who have play any ac games know the part where you have to climb up to a vantage point and synchronize to unlock the locations of all secrets in a location it 's still there but now you also have to do that on the sea but through destroying a fort in an area the global map is divided into about 15 parts (never counted the exact amount and each part 's surface is blurred until you destroy the fort 's defenses and then get to the fortress and kill the commander (somewhat like fighting a ship just harder beside the main story and synchronizing at seas there are tons of activities you can do when you get bored you can find treasure maps and then look for the location solve mayan puzzles dive underwater to collect treasures sneaking to a warehouse and steal materials to sell hunting legendary ships collect music sheets which unlocks new chants your crew sings when you are exploring the sea hunt animals on land to unlock upgrades and craft outfits and also harpooning sharks and whales upgrading your ship is also essential to be able to progress through the game you will have no chance fighting a huge ship with only a handful of cannons and low hull armor this is part of the fun making your ship stronger and then pawning those cocky spanish / british fleet (try using your upgraded ship to destroy 3 frigates in a row it 's fun there is also a kind of mini games where you have a fleet of ships which you can send to do shipping missions that require a certain amount of time to complete like most social games out there if you have friends who also play this game they can help your ship complete the mission faster you can add captured ships to the fleet to make them able to complete bigger missions with bigger rewards there 's also a simple turn based combat system to make a trading route safer it 's pretty fun at first but in the end you just click everything and then forget about it (like social games now for the negatives i feel that the secrets and chests you can find on the global is too scattered (maybe it 's meant to be that way i 've been meaning to collect everything but there 's just too many things to collect (i'm sure it 's a good thing for some people the stealth aspect felt improved but still needs some tweaking it 's pretty difficult to move quickly from cover to cover when edward wants to climb and jump on everything (it's annoying not a significant problem though\",\n",

       " \"for the most part assassin 's creed iv black flag is a fantastic game for ease of interpretation i have decided to break my thoughts on the game down into a simple pros and cons list pros the open world sailing /plundering/exploring while aboard the jackdaw is by far the best aspect of the game the main storyline is decent (aside from the classic assassin 's creed 'outside the animus sections that everyone hates combat is fluid and easy to learn although it was very clearly designed for console all of the enviornments are beautiful and well designed voice acting was well done and there weren 't too many npcs with the same voices the upgrade system seems pretty reasonable outside of the fact that once you have enough money you can basically buy every upgrade without putting in any work to collect materials etc cons the game was very much designed for console which produces quite a few problems for pc users the ubisoft launcher is absolutely terrible and i have had several problems getting it to boot up properly also you will be unable to play the game if your ubisoft launcher has problems so there is no way to bypass this terrible system even with a fairly well built gaming pc higher level graphics options are etremely taxing and framerate drops are common gameplay becomes repetitive after a certain point and the quests outside of the main storyline aren 't anything to write home about after you have maxed out all of the upgrades for the jackdaw /edward, nothing really presents a challenge very little replay ability the cutscenes for sucessfully boarding a ship are all identical except for the fact that they are re -skinned depending on if the ship is spanish english or pirate hunters this is quite annoying if you pillage more that 10 ships (you definitely will i already mentioned this above but the 'real life sections of the game where you exit the animus are terrible every time one came up i found myself saying 'please end this stupidity so i can go back to the story that i care about perhaps some people feel differently about these scenes but most seem to agree that the game would have been better if they had been left out all together multiplayer is clunky and feels like an afterthought there is no real opportunity to play with friends in the way that would actually be fun (a fleet of customized ships sailing around engaging in massive battles and accomplishing various goals conclusion i really did (and still do enjoy this game there are very few high quality pirate themed games on the market and black flag definitely fills that need the game is by no means a masterpiece of storytelling nor is it a real divergence from the classic assassin 's creed model however it is a ton of fun to play (especially if you love pirates and the add -ons for the delux edition are worth playing as well i would give this game a rating of 7 /10 simply because of the clunky conversion from console to pc and the constant issues with the ubisoft launcher if black flag was as good on pc as it is on console i would give it a 9 /10.\",\n",

something almost double the recommended to actually play this game at a stable framerate even on normal settings i 've owned this game for a couple years am only now getting around to playing it because it 's just such a bad port that being said this game is actually really good i wish i could have played it sooner it isn 't without it 's faults however pros -large open world to explore -lots of collectables unlockables -fun gameplay -good story -ship battles cons -gameplay can be frustrating at times -collectables are mostly used as a 'gameplay time extender -some story missions are just kind of dumb or trial error -earning money relies on 'kenway's fleet story you play as an employee at abstergo industries a private company built on animus technology that records edits genetic memory data to make movies you are part of a team going through the genetic dna memories of subject 17 who 's biological history makes him one of the most valuable subjects for animus technology as you 'play' through his genetic memories you soon find that things are not what they seem an ancient conspiracy emerges about an age old war against assassin 's templars bordering on the deranged shows itself you are soon tasked by your superiors with finding out about something called the 'observatory' as soon as possible playing through the memories you are in the role of edward kenway a privateer /pirate of the early 1700s who 's friends with blackbeard himself you must use all yours edwards resources in order to find out about the observatory what power it holds gameplay features  the game starts off witha thud that turns into a bang eventually after 4 or so hours you are in the actual meat of the game with your own ship crew island hideout everything is upgradeable but not everything is useful your house for example has about 3 upgrades all of which do absolutely nothing you get multiplayer rewards for upgrading it completely yea that 's what we want from our single player games multiplayer rewards anyways not everything is all bad you can upgrade your ship your weapons armor via crafting add other new additions to your island hideaway like hookers a bonfire a tavern most of which are still pretty disappointing i bought the bonfire thinking it would be this big epic burning man celebration on the beach but it turns out it was just a camp fire with people around it whoopie upgrading your ship is the most important thing you can possibly do in this game you get materials for it by taking down other ships or raiding plantations stockpiles each ship you take down you can either add to your fleet lower your wanted repair your ship or just sink the bloody thing sinking is easier but cuts your booty by about half the fleet is a sort of mini game where each ship you capture can go on trade routes to earn money random loot for your mansion to display or to equip on yourself or your ship i don 't really like the idea of rng loot systems but this one 's alright it 's set up kind of like a mobile game where you take out enemy ships on routes then send ships that are capable on the voyages which can range from 5 minutes to actual days to complete it 's a waiting game but it 's also the best way to earn money in the game i don 't like that if you don 't use this minigame you are basically gimped for coin money in the actual game itself isn 't easy to come by chests are filled with paultry sums that don 't add up quick enough for what you need to buy in my travels in the game after about 40 hours of gameplay i 've maybe run across 40k total while just sending ships out to do missions netted me over 100k by just turning the game off waiting for missions to complete combat platforming is also a mixed bag sometimes it works perfectly other times it 's janky as all hell at times edward will run wild clinging to walls jumping off of every little thing you don 't want him to while others he does exactly what you were trying to do during combat sometimes counters just don 't work you 'll be stuck in a quick succession chain attack by one enemy others they will always work you 'll never get hit the biggest issue i have though is how poorly designed the combat system is in general simply attacking an enemy takes about 4x longer to kill than a counter kill so there 's really no point in attacking first as it just leaves you open you 're better off just countering or throwing a smoke bomb instantly killing everyone around you there are those cool bad ass moments when you are on a freeflow combo killing spree that make attacking worthwhile but it 's just a less effective way of dealing with enemies then there are ship battles which i must say are this games bread butter far more time was spent perfecting ship combat than the melee combat starting out you can 't take on squat but as you upgrade your ship you will be able to take on the dreaded man o 'war vessels even add them to your fleet then there are the big legendary ships which are meant to be taken on only when you 've fully upgraded your ship those fights are doozies you get mortars cannons heavy shots fire barrels chain shots quick shots that target vulnerabilities you 've made from other attacks oh and you can ram the crap out of other ships once you get a big ram you can pretty much monster truck your way over smaller ships with ease as you keep attacking ships your wanted level goes up which summons hunters which get stronger more frequent the higher level your wanted gets you can use your wanted level as bait to lure out better ships to add to your fleet or get more materials to sell or upgrade with the crafting in this game is basically copy /pasted from ac3 you 'll need to hunt animals use their hides to add /upgrade your arsenal defenses the difference is now you can hunt whales sharks the best way for me to describe these fights are comparing them to the big aligator boss fight in re4 you harpoon them latch on they pull you around dive down to hide then they attack your ship if you don 't hit them in time it 's almost the exact same formula from that re4 boss fight just replace the big crocodile with sharks whales there are also random events in the game like the white whales or trade routes that give good coin or loot these appear as blue r -boat symbols on your minimap are available for limited times only once found they automatically share with anyone on your u -play friends list so your friends can do them too not your steam list though so if you have a lot of steam friends but not u -play the share feature is basically worthless here finally the collectables these range from simple chests to missions to animus fragments there are a ton of them doing them all will take a considerable amount of time probably extend gameplay by at least 3x i say this as i remember the one mission that put 3 animus fragments in jump off points that forced you to treck back through the entire island again after getting each one literally extending gameplay of that one mission by at least 3x some collectables do this others are simply put on the path so you can get them as you progress i don 't know if there 's a reward for collecting everything since i haven 't done it yet overall if you are looking for a great open world adventure game with a pirate theme have capable hardware then this is worth the buy it 's frustrating at times but the pros do outweigh the cons in the long run just be aware that this game isn 't perfect i 'd go on but i 'm out of characters to type\",\n",

       " \"'alright, lads i ’ll give you blackbeard ’s honest opinion you ask me 'can this new captain promise you a life of prizes plunder and adventure aye assassin 's creed iv black flag is an action -adventure video game developed by ubisoft montreal and published by ubisoft story i highly recommend playing previous assassin 's creed titles to catch up on the story and have understanding of the lore and events to simply not feel lost just like in previous titles black flag features two storylines set in different time periods with one following the events that took place in assassin 's creed 3 in present day you play as an unnamed character hired by abstergo entertainment to gather material for an animus -powered interactive feature film gathering of that material takes place in animus where our character gets to explore 18th century caribbean sea during the golden age of piracy in that period we play as edward kenway welsh privateer -turned-pirate who looks for a way to get rich in order to return to his wife back home a way that as he finds out soon enough will put him in a middle of the conflict between templars and assassins gameplay black flag takes most of the gameplay mechanics from previous title but puts a bigger emphasis on naval part so it can fit the pirate setting it 's a mixture of well known land based gameplay from previous games with ship -based exploration of open seas and naval combat a taste of which we got in ac 3 modern day part has changed as now it 's played in first person focused on solving different mini -games and completing basic objectives game features a massive open world with many small and medium sized locations to explore unlike previous titles where you had one or multiple bigger cities those locations can be caves plantations cities and more all of them feature a set of activities collectibles or side tasks you can complete known from previous games synchronize with the viewpoints to uncover a map find different collectibles from shanties to messages in a bottle or complete different missions such as classic assassination contracts or main story related missions land missions are typical to the franchise and feature tailing collecting items chases escorts assassinations and so on big part of them includes using stealth climbing or combat and all 3 elements are pretty similar to previous entry stealth still allows you to use items such as benches haystacks or bushes to remain undetected and mixing it with climbing allows you to swiflty make your way through rooftops or trees in order to be unnoticed just like in previous titles enemies have two stages of alertness first they become suspicious about what they see and explore the area if they spot you fully they enter a combat state eliminate enemies and dispose their bodies in order to remain undetected use eagle vision to mark and track specific targets and be on a lookout for alarms and patrols to make your way through locations like a ghost if stealth fails there is combat edward can use fists hidden blade or two swords to slash through his enemies with addition of useful tools like pistols or smoke bombs for support featuring same combat system as previous title black flag is all about speed and being flashy slashing enemies in mere seconds and then starting a killstreak you can do basic counters dodges disarms or you can grab enemies to make them a human shield you can use tools as support from pistols allowing you to quickly eliminate enemies from range to classic smoke bombs helpful when you need to escape different types of enemies require a use of multiple strategies there is no medicine around so you have to be careful about getting hit and if that happens you have to run away and lose your enemies or slowly wait for regeneration to kick in collected hard earned money can be spend in the shops to buy new weapons ammo or outfits most of the upgrades comes in a crafting format edward has to kill and skin wildlife in order to upgrade different pouches to carry more items increase amount of pistol holders or even craft special outfits after being done on the land you set sail and venture onto mighty sea to become a pirate legend sea -based gameplay relies on you exploring and discovering caribbeans while plundering and improving your ship along the way sail through calm seas while listening to shanties through storms and hurricanes to discover locations destroy forts to uncover a map (plus to get naval contracts and most importantly attack enemy ships and board them to gain loot that allows you to upgrade your own ship attacking enemy ships increases your notoriety with pirate hunters send after you at specific point from edward 's cabin you can improve different aspects of your ship more cannons better armor bigger cabins and so on naval combat is an improved version of ac 3 combat with bigger variety of tools to work with plus already mentioned addition of boarding enemy ships there are also main missions set on the sea which include boarding enemy ships collecting different items and tailing (there is a lot of tailing in this game also few side activities such as treasure hunting underwater exploration or legendary ships playtime, replayability and other modes  it took me 50 hours to 100 bf which is a very reasonable amount of playtime worth mentioning it was not my first time on the sea so it might take additional 5 to 10 hours to beat worth playing once again after a while if you miss naval combat and tropical islands there is multiplayer which just like in previous titles is used to train abstergo employees in combat matching them against each other hunt and be hunted in a dangerous game of cat and mouse with different skills modes characters and maps because it 's the last ac game with multiplayer (unity only features coop you will have a slighty easier job when it comes to finding players if you are interested worth mentioning mp is land -based only no ship combat with friends or anything like that pros and cons  strongest point of black flag lies in naval gameplay doesn 't matter if you are casually sailing listening to shanties while looking at calm open sea in front of you to relax or if you are fighting for your life against toughest opponents game has to offer it 's always a fantastic experience improved combat is superb new additions in side activities make exploration very enjoyable only weak point of naval part is grinding bit required to upgrade your ship as last most powerful upgrades require quite a lot of materials to gather land gameplay didn 't change a lot but there is nothing wrong in that devs polished already good assassin 's creed 3 gameplay and changed few elements they made open world different so it can fit the setting kept elements such as controls and movement /stealth options removed rather boring parts like settlement and pointless crafting of furniture to make in total a better game enganging story that manages to mix old as time fight between two orders and pirate theme is worth mentioning even if edward is not the same person as portrayed in the trailers unfortunately there are still some weak elements in the game while flashy sword combat is rather mediocre lacks a good swordplay gets quickly repetitive and movement got weirdly clunky with edward quite often blocking himself or jumping onto elements something i don 't remember being an issue in ac3 story is great but modern part of the game is not as good as in previous entries additional information  ubisoft connect is required to launch and play this title final words and conclusion  black flag delivers fantastic naval experience with good land -based gameplay but needs better combat and modern day is not as good as in previous titles still highly recommended\",\n",

kenway encounters a mysterious man carrying a message with the promise of a grand reward from a local governor posing as the courier edward soon gets entangled in the millennia -long feud between templars and assassins the former looking for a powerful device known as ‘the observatory despite such an intriguing premise the story of ac4 is rarely exciting most of the side characters around edward not to mention the man himself simply prove bland most of the time events and discussions be them pirate -y business or more esoteric ones do not convey that feeling of mystery and excitement

as strongly -pushed as in some others it ’s the usual system that sees edward use thick bushes or crowds to become undetectable from enemies move bodies and instantly kill any unaware foe thanks to the iconic concealed blades (or even unarmed if you want to go non -lethal). how does a random pirate know about secret assassin techniques you ask beats me https ://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2858351754 ground naval combat  combat on foot will put blades guns and several gadgets at your disposal each blade set has different stats like damage speed etc but honestly this won ’t matter much and i saw no sensible difference between many guns work in the same way but this time around the damage stat matters fights are melee -focused, with edward being able to take on crowds of enemies that will mostly attack one at a time and have some specific abilities depending on their class (brutes, for instance can counter -attack and throw grenades ranged enemies are dangerous but you can use nearby ones as a human shield if timed right the biggest flaws of combat in ac4 are how overpowered counters are allowing you to remain unscathed as long as your timing is right and how tremendously broken smoke bombs and guns result allowing you to respectively stun all enemies in a large area or instantly kill anyone with a headshot (even bosses these things aren ’t even hard to come by refills are common and cheap it never felt at any point like it was a dangerous situation naval combat will put you at the helm of the jackdaw outfitted with cannons chain shots and explosive barrels to lay waste on your enemies other ships can be freely attacked and plundered board them after inflicting enough damage to get 100 of their loot or sink them for 50 in both cases that will be used as resources to upgrade your ship naval combat is fun feels dynamic and has a weather system with storms etc that still can rival today ’s titles boarded ships may also be captured and added to your personal fleet used in a specific minigame quests events  each city and outpost will always have a number of contracts to undertake mostly assassination or naval expeditions with a variety of objectives like escorting or destroying specific ships there are also dynamic events mostly at sea such as storms that disable fast travel and spawn dangerous anomalies like tsunamis royal convoys that house great riches but are well -guarded, or rare animals to hunt like the mythical white whale legendary ships are the ultimate test of your seamanship and you ’ll need all the best upgrades to defeat them only to receive a lot of money you won ’t have a use for anymore https ://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2859572582 progression upgrades  progression in ac4 is represented by the quality of your gear both on the jackdaw and on edward himself as you rack up money and materials from pillaging hunting assassinating and looting you ’ll afford better guns improved machinery for your ship and will be able to craft improvements with the pelts of hunted beasts that will extend your maximum health inventory capacity or the effectiveness of some accessories some of these things may only be acquired after completing each ‘set’ of missions or collectibles but are usually worth the effort as they bring special effects or perks that ‘normal’ gear doesn ’t usually have\",\n",

much blame on ac3 because of the assassin design and what his atitude was in general connor in my honest opinion was a brutal as hell assassin a loving and caring person when it came to his natural enviormeant the village and the homestead but a literall devil on the battlefield characther design and atitude in general were pretty good and didn 't lack in anything if you understood the point of his characther overall ac3 overall was a pretty great game can 't be top tier like ac2 or bf but it was a pretty great game in general now for bf bf is either great terific amazing glorious or god tier it 's pretty much an undescribable game for me really i enjoyed the hell out of it as a fan of the franchise for a long time the overall core gameplay of it was smooth and fast paced and it was just an adrenaline rush in its own ways the game offered us a better and more extende naval combat system which we have been asking for from ac3 and its probably the most fun you could also have in the game the game in general is mainly covered 60 sea and 40 land making the naval combat one of the more important aspects of the game the naval combat in bf is far superiour than what other pirate /ship battle games have and its quite alot of fun to just destroy the hell out of some giant fleets now overall the story and characther of the game in bf the story picks off some time latter from ac3 overall your characther is unknown as he is some kind of employe working for abstergo as a double agent of some sorts since you technicaly share intel with the assassins troughout the game in the modern day missions of the game shaun and rebeca overall the modern day segments are covered in a first person perspective and are just a bit odd fun but odd the fun thing you could really have in the modern day segments is just randomly collecting some qr codes and hacking pc 's, yes hacking is a thing in this game the hacking is pretty fun altough it repeats the same short minigame of either switching frequencies turning a line from point a to point b in order to unlock the file or just a simple cracking the firewall type of game pretty short but they are also pretty fun in general the story of bf takes before the actions of ac3 so that means your way behind playing as the grandfather of connor kenway captain edward james kenway or as people called him that started off as a privateer at the begining of the game overtaken for the lust of having a better life greed is his main priority he takes as he pleases and doesn 't give a rotten damn about anything but hey thats the usual which you expect from a pirate but troughout the game thinking that he may be some bad characther he overall isn 't, he did get a bad reputation with both secret organizations but overtime learnt the morals of which had taken him quite some time to understand over that course he sought to fight along side the creed and follow its morals he also was technicaly the founder and grand master of the english assassin 's brotherhood he grew to be quite a likeable characther in my opinion atleast the core gameplay of it is as same as it was in ac3 with a few difrent changes to fit the playstyle of a pirate duel wielding cutlasses and owning 4 flintlock pistols is the deal with ac4 the naval combat also has been improved from ac3 and also making it the main thing in the game the game adds another important characther to it the jackdaw which is your ship that you sail trough the caribeans plundering and taking as you want it 's important that you take of your ship as it becomes quite the game changer if you upgrade it to max and all overall the game is good it 'll take you aroudn 20 -23h to complete that is if you spend next to no time on the naval contratcs templar hunts assassin contracts and such oh yeah and upgrading your ship which will take you quite a while to find the parts as there also a new mechanic added to game called treasure hunting you can find treasure maps from dead or unconcious corpses stranded on the shores of the locations you discover each treasure map will containt either gold or an upgraded plan for the jackdaw and some aditional gold sure gota love that pirate feel afterwards anyways got a bit offtrack there the game at its base is great and all has a very small amount of glitches exclude the sinken rising ship thing which ocasionaly happens with the jackdaw and so fort the gameplay is great and is just amazing in some sense as you feel like a genuine pirate with the tools at your disposal a much recommended game and also a favourite in my category as it just captures everything you could need in an ac game\",\n",
       " \"the problem with not playing these games in order is that they all share the same sci -fi backstory which is continued from game to game although the emphasis on this part of the story varies per game i don 't think it 's all that great although there are some very neat moments when the plot of the past and present overlap they all have on thing in common being outstanding virtual tourism games since they create a remarkable look into the past which despite some more or less obvious artistic liberties feels quite authentic most of the time bustling city life and impressive vistas were there right from the start and there hasn 't really been another games series yet that managed to pull of something comparable chances are if a particular era you like is represented by an assassin 's creed game that representation will be the most appealing rendition of it in a video game as others have said ac ii and black flag are the best in the series ac ii shines thanks to its fascinating story and setting in renaissance italy and black flag is just a really enjoyable gorgeous pirate game the original assassin 's creed has aged significantly that 's true but it 's still a rather impressive looking game with huge cityscapes at the time of its release it was one of the best looking games on the market and to many including myself it was one of the games that really showcased the power of the last console generation and contemporary pcs the fact that you can scale any building in the game 's vast cities was just unheard of especially with such smooth and responsive animations and controls (for the time the first time i climbed a tower and saw that dramatic camera pan around it is one of the most memorable gaming moments of that era even if it 's now a cliché for ubisoft open world games combat is alright quite graphic but it can be both too easy and unfair depending on the situation while the cities are large and fairly detailed there isn 't really much to do outside of the passable but repetitive missions both future and past story lines are solid but nothing to write home about however if you like conspiracy stories it might be just the thing for you assassin 's creed ii is better than its predecessor in every way the story is filled with charismatic and interesting characters the renaissance italy is almost overflowing with color compared to the almost monochromatic predecessor which used strong color correction post -processing to give each location and distinct but rather dull look controls are smoother combat is much more enjoyable (still dated though this was too shortly after arkham asylum the game that defined modern third person brawling after all mission design is more varied there 's an overabundance of side activities the modern day plot really takes off it 's a great game a modern classic enjoyable without having played its predecessor but more enjoyable if you 've played it since experiencing the impressive amount of progress is just remarkable the rest of the ezio trilogy brotherhood and revelations is best described as more of the same there are a few minor gameplay additions and modifications but nothing too major most people stayed on board because they wanted to experience the story of ezio they feel somewhat lackluster compared to ii although nobody would deny how competent and polished they are assassin 's creed iii is a bit of an odd game expectations were high after the end of the ezio trilogy and many players were hungry for a new scenario with speculation about ancient egypt or medieval japan being the setting running high the announcement of it being set during the time of the american revolution was seen as catering to american schoolchildren to put it mildly at least outside of the us development was plagued with issues and the game was plagued by bugs upon release albeit nowhere near as much as a certain later game in the series with the colonial setting the large sprawling cities the series is known for were gone as there were no major cities in america at the time and with them much of the city parkours replaced only partially by lengthy and unwelcome sections in nature the half -native american protagonist was an odd choice there were jumps in the storyline as the result of last -minute changes to the game etc a complete revamp of the combat system was promised but it felt very similar and somewhat dated the modern day story is again quite noticeable and important overall it 's by many considered to be one of the weakest entries in the series but again if you 're interested in seeing a rather pretty rendition of that era it might have some appeal one aspect was however well received sea battles which were transformed into a major gamplay element with the next entry black flag and its standalone dlc freedom cry are somewhat of a departure for the first time players are not controlling an assassin modern day sections were significantly paired back and now resemble a point and click adventure game you might almost forget they are there the writing is sharp fun and energetic it looks absolutely stunning at times especially on the ocean during storms the soundtrack is probably the best in the series the map is overflowing with activities if you are a completionist then this might be the game that breaks you there are large cities caves jungles ancient ruins wrecks massive boss ships small islands treasure maps with corresponding treasures just so much to do ship to ship combat plays a huge role it 's not realistic but there is a modicum of strategy involved and the final boarding of battered and damaged enemy ships is still one of the most remarkable things i 've ever seen in a videogame you can climb masts and other parts of every ship just like you can climb buildings and as two ships get close enough to each other the animation and control system elegantly deals with it combat is a bit of a mixed back i really don 't see any progress but it 's alright if too easy most of the time next up there 's rogue basically black flag again with a slightly different setting but interestingly this is the first time the player is seeing the story pan out from the other side of the conflict this game was meant to be somewhat of a second prize for the old console generation which did not receive unity the next big entry in the series that was developed at the time but it turned out to be much better reviewed and was later ported to pc it 's really good if you 're looking for more of black flag rogue does just that unity was meant to showcase the power of a new engine on new console hardware but it did not go as planned set during the french revolution in a stunning rendition of 18th century paris it 's easily the most visually impressive game in the series to date but the visuals and massive crowds (the series was always known for large crowds but unity turned it up to 11 with sometimes hundreds of characters on screen were too much for consoles and pcs of the time hideous glitches instability and other issues quickly ruined its reputation going from the open seas and sea battles to a single albeit pretty city location was perceived as a downgrade by many it didn 't help that controls were floaty the writing undecided and gameplay variation lacking after many patches and on modern hardware it 's perfectly playable now and if you want to explore a beautiful paris with more detail than pretty much any other open world game then this is still quite an attractive proposal\",\n",

       " \"black flags is a ac game and has bugs because ubisoft if you are having a v sync issues or stuttering with constant drops to 30fps there is a fix and it gives you alittle more performance as well you can either use the best method by pressing windows key +l to lock windows then unlock go back into game which gives you about 10 performance boost and runs smooth as butter or run the game as admin with vsync and triple buffering conrtolled by the gpu but you will still get some frame drops here and there but it fixes the drops to 30fps another issue you may get is freezing for a few seconds while sailing this is a glitch caused by fxaa so don 't use it also smaa blurs the water while moving i recomend using your gpu pannel for aa or msaa now to my review black flag is not a normal creed game mostly because its amazing and no game with an 'animus' in the story should be called amazing the other ac games are good don 't get me wrong i like them alot but not gta fallout elder scrolls witcher good black flag is nearly just that the mechanics in the game are polished and open exluding a few bugs the graphics are top notch for 2013 as well and with sweetfx and 4k it holds up great the naval combat is a blast :p, and the melee combat is great my only gripe is it is restricted to typicall ac themes i .e. don 't be killing civilians no taking someone elses ship and building that one up limited to what weapons you can hold on to i am a pirate so i should be swashbuckling stabby cut throat whore mongering drunkard fun the story is ok but sometimes unbearably in accurate how they portray real pirates (simular to aciii with its horrible geography and historic figures and they are just there to move the plot black beard is nothing like he was in real life this is a 6 ,5'+ 280 pound man who left his crew to die by grounding the queen annes revenge to keep the money for himself ubisoft portrays him as average size fairly nice inept at piracy and loyal person don 't even get me started on black bart .the whole animus thing is bearley a discussion and is still needless they could have just made it you are a pirate go and pirate things no need for the same old story of made up blah blah in historical localations but the open world lets you forget about that though you can never get a new ship or are able to capture one which is a real shame though you can upgrade the ship with the world being so big and grand and your crew singing while you sail its easy to get sucked in (songs like leave her johnny drunken sailor and fathom the bowel i find myself singing at times to some odd looks from people the mini games are a lot of fun and at times i just like to play a game of checkers while listening to the 'live band who will play period music .(and each region gets their own songs based on the inhabitants like an english settlement will play old english and irish songs like all for my grog another gripe i do have for this game is its a bear to run most are lucky to see 30fps @high res ultra i modded it and it tends to run around 45 -50fps at 1080p with high on everything but shadows with an i7 2gb nvidia and 16gigs ram so make sure you can run it if you are on a lower end machine or laptop a 980ti will muscle it at 1440p at 60fps with sweet fx but the gameworks features will need to be off because its gameworks to maintain 60 100 of the time i need to drop a few setting down to very high even on a 980ti for a 1080ti 4k is easily attainable but you will need to ajust your settings no joke this is one of the most stressful games to run with all of it 's pc features black flag is the one of two games of the series that was developed on pc then ported .(aciii bring the other which is odd it still has bugs given it was made for pc since it was developed for pc it has a wide array of graphic options with many different setting to them i guess none of this is surprising seeing how with aciii ubi forgot to add a resolution option in game this is a game i would highly recommend to people who even hate the series because this pirate game shouldn 't of bothered with the name assassins creed no it is to good this is just black flag to me and black flag is great oh and for some reason i always seem to play this when i 've had a few it just makes the debauchery better i think\",\n",

       " \"as a long time assassin 's creed fan i must say i had my doubts for this particular title with assassin 's creed 2 and brotherhood alike being my all time fave ac titles i was rather spektical about this at first the whole idea of how naval combat in ac3 was horrible and made me rather avoid this title but thankfully i took my chances and played this it is absolutely incredible simply amazing the gameplay like previous ac titles is well worked and serves a great time while it follows the same idea of counter killing just about anyone via combat remains classic and at it 's finest naval combat has been refined in an amazing way that made me simply love it compared to ac3 's naval combat edward is a real fun character altogh he seems like the worst assassin at first he appears to have a much better liking than connor the story is fun intresting and all around enjoyable map is huge no need to explain on that detail it 's big no other word needed like any other ac games it can have some humerous but only sometimes game breaking glitches ubisoft get your head straigth please unity just shows how much people can stand your slackering people tend to hate uplay and i actually did at first but hey it 's not that horrible as long as i don 't have to use it to actually get in my games so for all i care i just ignore it when the game finally installs great pc port just love it solid 60 frames nonstop assassin 's creed iv black flag is an amazing title it serves the idea of a good game for both ac fans and non ac fans while this may not be your typical 'loyal to the creed against the templar 's type of game it well enough deserves a top spot in the franchise and sits very well with the legacy ac2 holds all in all i 'd give assassin 's creed black flag a 9 .7/10 a must have if you enjoy these types of open world games\",\n",
       " \"“absolutely breathtaking is a very good way of describing assassin ’s creed iv black flag from my experience at least i ’m very happy that ubisoft decided to go back in time to a very interesting period in history the golden age of piracy not only does this game visit a stunning caribbean setting but there are also numerous enhancements to the gameplay and graphics i ’ve put about 30 hours into it so far and i ’m 60 towards total completion in black flag you can sail your own pirate ship and explore a vast caribbean sandbox consisting of uncharted islands shipwrecks and 3 major cities there ’s a vast open ocean to travel across but the new convenient fast travel system has eliminated the annoyances of fast travel in the previous games (such as finding a fast travel point in order to fast travel now after discovering a location you can quickly travel there at any time you wish each of the cities is different in its style and residents visiting each of them gave me the feeling that i was visiting a different part of the world havana has the spanish theme kingston has the english theme and nassau has the pirate theme i was very impressed with the amount of detail put into each location and this can be said for the more remote areas such as the jungles and beaches a lot of work was put into making the environments feel genuine the gameplay has been slightly improved since assassin ’s creed iii there are many new tools to use (some are really neat and new animations for fighting sequences the enemies feel more dangerous than they did in previous games which are good because i always found the combat to be a little too easy :p black flag has made sure to keep the fights challenging the graphics are another point worth mentioning the anvil -next engine looks even better than it did in assassin ’s creed iii which is to be expected but it went above my expectations the new weather system features full night and day cycles complete with the most intense storms i ’ve ever seen in games nvidia users get the full experience with txaa anti -aliasing and improved physx though radeon users still have a great looking game a big reason i bought this game was because of the story which is aaa quality as usual the templar twist in assassin ’s creed iii still beats anything that black flag has thrown at me but that doesn 't mean i ’m disappointed there are many famous pirates that some history buffs will go crazy over your character edward has one hell of a journey turning from pirate to assassin and even plays a templar for a while it ’s very well thought out with real events being tied into fictional events part of the assassin ’s creed universe there ’s so much more for me to talk about but if anyone has made it this far you ’ll probably be sick of this fan boy rant if you enjoy the series you won ’t need this review if you ’re unsure i would take a risk and buy it there ’s so much to do and a great story to boot\",\n",

here 's the thing you 're actually 'playing' the memories of edward kenway for a company called 'abstergo entertainment they claim to be gathering footage for an up and coming pirate movie they 're doing on the characters in the 1715 's and they need your help because you 're naturally gifted with this 'memory-brain-meld' technology (it's basically vr but vr in sword art online style but that 's my guess anyhoo .) i could write a few more paragraphs on the story but lets just say things are definitely not as black and white as they seem between abstergo and their goals or the people *you* work with for that mater http ://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=754099384 gameplay: i could break the gameplay into a ton of sub categories but for simplicity i 'm going to focus on the two main combat features kenway 's fighting /stealth/etc, and naval combat kenway kenway himself has quite the assortment of secondary weapons even several different primary weapons and don 't get me started on the pickup weapons weapons for days kenway at first just goes to his dual swords for combat but eventually he gets the sneaky -sleeve-daggers. there 's probably a formal official name for them but i 'm calling them sneaky -sleeve-daggers. depending on the weapons being used the animations are different so a counter with swords looks and feels different then a counter with daggers or even a counter when unarmed or holding a pickup -weapon. the hand -to-hand combat is tailored for ambush striking and then running away and finding a place to hide or you can be a man like me and duel your way through the english lines optional you can also die a lot like me because you 're playing the game incorrectly (my point is that the game isn 't over if you get caught normally there are numerous ways to get to objectives you can sneak in fight in or a hybrid strategy i personally like picking up sharp shooter 's rifles after they die and sniping my target and running away making 'woop woop woop noises .) jackdaw when kenway obtains himself a ship he names it the jackdaw a jackdaw is a small bird part of the crow family (all the european readers are probably like 'duh', but hey i 've never seen one okay i 'm sorry !). the jackdaw starts out quite fragile but as you loot and pirate around you get enough money and resources to upgrade her and upgrade her you do with guns armor cargo aesthetics sails ammo crew quarters trust me when i say that you 're definitely investing in this ship now comes the part i was skeptical about going into the game sailing a ship hands down this was one of the most awesome and freeing sensations in the game when you 're sailing well and can direct your ship where you want to go the game is golden couldn 't be better but when you 're pinned between an enemy ship and getting mortared by the local fortress that magic dries up faster then rain in the sahara so the naval combat is touch and go as a whole it adds to the experience and definitely doesn 't bog down the gameplay in my opinion however i will note that some of the most difficult challenges in the game involve the jackdaw so when the game says 'hey, you should upgrade your ship before you do this mission you darn well toot 'n should upgrade that crap if you don 't you have no one to blame but yourself for how much death you 'll have here 's where we come to my final note about the gameplay specifically when dealing with the jackdaw you will hit literal walls that you cannot pass unless you go pirate -farm for a bit so you can upgrade your ship some people might be able to get by without it but i had to go explore around you can 't really shoot straight through the story even though the story is quite linear and you can go from story chapter to story chapter there is a type of 'gear check that is in place to slow you down ac black flag was designed to take loads of time to play to some people believe it or not that 's a turn off for a game to others it 's like 'yes, inject that into my arm with an iv please ahhhh yeah http ://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=757730192 conclusion: i knew this review would become huge i haven 't even been able to get into the finer details of the different weapons you unlock for kenway or the jackdaw the mini -games, the multiplayer (ugh... don 't buy it for the multiplayer please it took forever to get it to work ), special events getting world completion uplay uplay achievements oh crap uplay hey hi did you make it to the bottom of this review this game requires you to play the game through uplay , uplay must run in the background even if you boot the game through the steam client that 's one of the biggest gripes people will probably have about the game other then getting stuck on ambient objects while trying to parkour ack i couldn 't even talk about the parkour\",\n",

       " \"sheets torn but on we sail  https ://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2748259715 i am always wary of going into an older game like this one hoping that my rose -tinted glasses haven 't obscured the reality of outdated mechanics thankfully black flag holds up exactly as i remember good bad and ugly i 'm still intoxicated by the simple act of sailing around the caribbean still frustrated by the uneven free -running, and still conflicted about the story i personally think the good vastly outweighs the bad but the opposite could be true for those who don 't fall in love with the privateer fantasy i did though and thoroughly enjoyed living the pirate life aboard the jackdaw sailing the open seas brazenly attacking any ship worth looting using treasure maps to find hidden booty and discovering underwater shipwrecks to explore abstergo entertainment fully leaned into the pirate fantasy and it just feels right but on the other side of the doubloon ac black flag suffers from average to poor mission design a middling story broken immersion wonky controls repetitive combat /stealth, and one glaring technical issue but still it's a pirate 's life for me ! so weigh anchor and hoist the mizzen mates ! set sail across one of the if not the most intricately crafted bodies of water i 've seen in gaming this is a title where i rarely used fast -travel in the over -world. ubisoft accounted for so many little details in the sea and on your ship that they never fail to provoke a smile the way the jackdaw navigates up and over each wave and how every one seems to naturally occur and then lazily drift away or when the sun hits the crest of a swell changing its color to a lighter shade sometimes a storm will blow in pitting you against giant rogue waves and water spouts intent on crushing your impudent vessel dragging you down to davy jones locker the sea is alive and wants you to know it but simply sailing isn 't the only factor in a buccaneer 's life to truly become the terror of the west indies you need to fight pillage and commandeer everything within spyglass distance the sword fights and gunplay are simple button -mashing fun which admittedly may be too repetitive for some people but i had a blast it 's just easy enough that you feel more badass than over powered but naval combat takes more skill to master on the open ocean you see gunboats frigates and man o wars everywhere but none can stand against the speed and ferocity of your little jackdaw even outnumbered outgunned or caught in a storm you can persevere with keen use of your various weapons and ship speeds spot your quarry from afar then engage with mortars as you move closer once in range destroy their sails and masts with your chain shot leaving them stunned and helpless as you unleash a symphony of destructive percussion the sights and sounds of the naval warfare are explosive and superbly captivating if you do tire of splintering enemy ships there is a good selection of side content to be found around the open world you can sail to an island with a storehouse and quietly plunder its valuable materials just pilfer the key and remain unseen to take what 's yours then drop anchor near a shipwreck using the diving bell to trap air for your descent into the depths exploring these muffled alien locales is markedly different from the rest of the game the mood is tense here there are many perils and you are totally unarmed while i enjoyed these sections the swimming controls and dangers in these areas can be frustrating for shizzle but they aren 't difficult to finish regardless there are other pirate hobbies to indulge in as well hunt and harpoon animals to craft character upgrades and find treasure maps where x does indeed mark the spot take on the formidable sea forts to turn them to your side and uncover points of interest on the map or test your mettle against the four legendary ship encounters it 's fun and lucrative to get distracted for an hour or more before you head to the next main mission but when the other peg drops  as much as i enjoyed living out ed kenway 's rum -soaked memories there are quite a few design choices or failures or limitations that definitely hamper the experience first and foremost when i started the game there was significant stuttering that occurred regularly it was five minutes before i quit i run a ryzen 5 2600x six -core rtx 2060 16gb ram it wasn 't my rig after applying the solutions found  here  the game ran at a rock -solid 60 fps almost my entire playthrough also i have seen online a few disconcerting things like the fact that ubisoft took the standard edition of the game off steam in favor of the more expensive 'gold edition assholes and i have read that some of the dlc items from said gold edition don 't even work with ubisoft 's new launcher these are unacceptable practices to be sure so do with this information what you will thankfully i was lucky enough to acquire the standard edition a while ago so with that out of the way my sea legs don 't work on land ! https ://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2755556039 one of my main issues with black flag is the on -foot controls the free -running is usually fun and fluid hopping from rooftops to trees then straight down into a hay pile where i wait silently to pull my prey in for a private meeting it 's enjoyable until it isn 't, when edward randomly comes to a full stop on an odd bit of geometry or straight up jumps to the wrong ledge or branch or even down to the ground this became seriously annoying and was exasperating because i enjoy the free -running in this game there are also the tailing missions which are painfully slow these ask you to follow a target and listen to their conversations without being seen sometimes forced to remain within a small area they make sense from an information -gathering perspective but are not fun and failing often means going back to the start of the process which is infuriating my final big issue is that there is too much ui leading to broken immersion the screen is constantly littered with hud elements repeated updates and tutorials you can toggle each of these separately which i did but the mini -map needed to stay on because the stealth and exploration are much harder without it the game relies on the mini -map to guide you to map markers and inform you of enemy movements without the map you would constantly be flipping your camera in every direction to check for roving patrols and high -perched gunners you can alleviate this with the ridiculous all -seeing eye that is the enemy tagging mechanic but this breaks my immersion more than just using the mini -map. obviously though some people may want to see through walls and to each their own homeward bound  as i write this review i realize the big issue with this game and with many of the assassin 's creed titles is that they are trying to do too much at once it 's historically accurate but there 's a bunch of sci -fi shenanigans in the background there 's the period -specific story the assassin /templar story and the present -day story it 's a stealth game in an open world and an action /sailing game with parkour now i 'm not saying i don 't like these things individually or even in groups but i think black flag would have benefited more from focusing solely on the pirate schtick yet for all its flaws i can 't help but love this game the pirate fantasy is so well realized that all my gripes slowly and serenely float away as i sail into the wild blue -green yonder\",\n",

come from aaa developers but assassin 's creed 4 most certainly delivered between responsive controls fun game mechanics a massive world to explore and an exciting story i enjoyed nearly every minute of this game though parts of the story do leave a bit to be desired and i was left with some unanswered questions at the end maybe it 's due to my lowered expectations after ac3 or maybe it 's because i 'm a sucker for pirate adventures and sea shanties but the latest installment of the assassin 's creed series just may be my new favorite controls basics the basic game controls are more or less the same as they 've always been run around jump and climb buildings and stab lots of enemies the familiar control scheme is satisfyingly responsive and though there were occurrences of edward doing something i didn ’t intend they were seldom most impressive however is the input detection i generally play assassin ’s creed games with an xbox controller since they don ’t require the precision of a mouse and allow for more fluid movement with the analog sticks but if i wanted to switch to the mouse and keyboard (for instance to more quickly navigate menus all i had to do was press a key or move the mouse and input automatically switched over when i want to switch back i pick up the controller again and can keep playing i didn ’t even have to enter the settings menu combat combat is incredibly satisfying if extremely simple and easy allowing you to either mash a single button until everyone 's dead or pull of some fun and impressive -looking combos with your swords and pistols the jackdaw  similar to ac3 you have some control over the ship 's speed allowing you to make tighter turns if necessary the ship does control rather sluggishly but that 's to be expected considering well it 's a ship and it 's actually a good bit more responsive than what i imagine steering a real boat is like naval combat is fairly straightforward allowing you to select from a myriad of weaponry for different scenarios use the broadside cannons to hit anything alongside you the chain -ball shooting chase cannons to hit enemies in front or launch fire barrels off the back of your ship to hit those behind you you can also upgrade the ship with new weapons like mortars and heavy shot for even more range and damage mechanics the world  the game world is absolutely massive with tons of areas to explore and things to collect and aside from a few story -critical areas the entire map is open to you from the moment you get your ship meaning if you want to ignore the story missions entirely and explore everything nothing ’s stopping you of course many areas of the map are far more dangerous than the starting areas but a nice upgrade system lets you plunder enemy ships for materials which you can then use to make your own ship stronger forts the map is divided up into sections with each section being home to a large fort or “base.” if you ’re able to destroy the fort and kill the fort leader the fort is then liberated opening up that section of the map to you this reveals locations and hunting areas for that section of the map as well as opens up some naval missions that you can complete for some extra cash kenway’s fleet  after you get a good ways into the story you gain control of your very own fleet from that point any enemy ship you plunder gives you the option to send it to your fleet once there you can send the ships on mini -missions similar to assassin missions from brotherhood trading goods for money by completing these missions you unlock new trade routes with new missions that can net you even more money however some routes are more dangerous than others and you have to first send some of your fleet into a mini -battle to make it safer for travel while overall a pretty small part of the game the fleet missions can be interesting and are certainly a good way to bring in some extra cash tailing and tagging  quite a few missions throughout the game involve following a target for a distance without letting them spot you this usually involves walking at a distance behind them and ducking into alleys or blending in with groups of people to avoid detecting black flag also introduces a new mechanic that allows you to “tag” up to ten enemies by focusing on them in eagle vision they are then highlighted when you return to your normal view and you can follow them even as they walk behind buildings or you would otherwise normally be unable to see them while a neat mechanic it does seem to make many tailing missions almost too easy graphics to be blunt and to the point the game looks gorgeous both aesthetically and graphically some of the most enjoyable parts for me were just sailing over the deep blue waters passing by other boats and islands the texture resolutions are certainly impressive and there were only a few times (generally during close -ups) when a noticeably low -res texture jumped out at me with the recent addition of physx capabilities smoke rising from fires and recently fired cannons also behaves much more realistically and everything ran surprisingly smoothly too i ’d heard some reports of poor optimization and consistently low framerates and was initially worried but i was able to set the game settings at near maximum with next to no problems at all only some slowdown during ship battles when there was a lot of smoke and considering i ’m running off a gtx480 i consider that to be pretty impressive story edward kenway  to avoid the risk of spoilers i won ’t detail too much here but i did find the game ’s story very enjoyable the characters are solid and there ’s certainly no lack of personality to be found edward is of course a pirate so everything he does is with his own and his crew ’s best interest in mind but that doesn ’t stop him from being able to care about others and as the story progresses edward really grows as a character one of my favorite aspects of ac2 i did however have some issues with the finale as the story ended with a relatively important task left incomplete and with a few overhanging questions that were never answered which made for a slightly less than satisfying conclusion the employee  meanwhile outside the animus you play as a new employee to abstergo entertainment a company aiming to bring the memories and experiences of people such as edward to the general public in the form of interactive movies unlike the previous games arcs with desmond your character in black flag is faceless and voiceless and you play from a first -person perspective restricted to your office building throughout the game it ’s certainly an interesting spin on both the purpose of the animus technology and the real -world portions of the game and not entirely unwelcome in my opinion since desmond ’s story while interesting seemd to almost competed for dominance with ezio ’s story at times now your time spent outside of the animus generally involves talking with your superiors and later on learning to hack your co -workers computers for some very interesting backstory the verdict  overall this is certainly one of the most fun games i ’ve played recently and one of the few that i actually had a hard time putting down it looks beautiful plays well and is responsive has an interesting story and overall some really fun mechanics despite a few flaws with the story that left questions hanging in my mind i enjoyed the majority of the time i spent with it and can say that this is a huge step up from the previous game\",\n",

       " \"this game has one of the best story -lines and without a doubt one of the best assassin 's creed game game -play wise the story is amazing takes unexpected turns quite sad at times and unpredictable the ending can bring tears to your eyes the protagonist edward kenway has great personality though not an assassin at first there 's nothing unlikable about him hunting fishing pirating and buying stuff to upgrade your gear and your ship over time really feels like quite an accomplishment the combat is fast -paced hack and slash third person swordplay combined with several guns is simply amazing the naval combat is an awesome and a completely new experience to the assassin 's creed series (yes, the previous game had a similar thing but with a lot of scripted game -play). every unique ship battle is an unforgettable experience in this game the voice actors have done an awesome job as well giving every character in the game an unique personality there are insane amount of collectibles available in this game but they do give promising rewards there are several outfits available in shops for you to try out from time to time and also a lot of weapons different kinds of guns many customization for your ship 's different parts etc while there 's no difficulty setting available in this game you do have the option to not upgrade your maximum health and your ship 's health to get a challenge a lot of the islands are almost identical and major locations also seem to have same textures which can feel boring at times the negative things are online events you need to complete several online events in order to reach 100 synchronization there are online missions that offer you a lot of customization rewards but that requires you to be online and it progresses in real -time. if you don 't have any friends on uplay that own the game and is willing to 'speed up your progress then your chances of getting all those rewards and completing the game to 100 would become very low overall it 's really great i would recommend anyone to buy it\",\n",

       " \"where do i start with a game like assassin 's creed iv black flag this game is utter bliss if ya just take your time with it and enjoy what it has to offer since assassin 's creed ii many fans have felt that the franchise had died brotherhood was too short revelations had a great story but was a slog and ac iii was a disappointment from start to finish so where does ac iv stand first let 's start with the story not the game 's strong suit at all but it is interesting and decently told story .the story is primarily in the animus this time not so heavy on the real world so i will begin with edward 's story (the animus then head into the real world story edward 's story is the most captivating story ac has seen since the ezio days (not to say i didn 't enjoy connor 's story as i did the story handles all sorts of cool things it touches up on great pirates like black beard benjamin hornigold calico jack and plenty of other cool historical figures one of the best things about the story are the interactions edward has with other characters and enemies alike you can genuinely feel the pain he has when interacting with caroline or his realization that the pirate life is not what it was cut out to be the story does a good job at displaying the growth edward has through out the journey and just how much you 've done to affect the world he 's in both positively and negatively he goes from an opportunistic thug to an honorable assassin and every moment of his growth is captivating edward is not as responsible as ezio or as boring as connor he 's his own breed and i feel like assassin 's creed has failed to replicate the success they 've had with protagonists like edward as for the templar propaganda and all the cool illusive things about the old ass creed stories they take place outside the animus and unfortunately you won 't really be finding any cool intrigue in edward 's story until super late into the game the real world story is disappointing you play as a silent simulation tester under abstergo industries they had the chance to show us how the villains of ac function in their coporate environment and it just kinda falls flat this one takes place after the death of desmond and barely gives us any answers to questions made by ac iii 's conclusion there 's some neat notes and secrets that sort of work like the item descriptions in dark souls that give the player info as to how sinister abstergo is most of the story here is within secrets like the aforementioned sticky notes and hacked computers that display little secret conversations and things alike if you 're just following the story and doing none of the side stuff in the real world it 's a shame to say but you 're missing out on a lot of interesting pieces there 's juicy stuff here story summary 7 .5-10 pretty good just not memorable it was a decent departure from the franchise next up is the bulk of the game its gameplay assassin 's creed black flag refined gameplay for ac in general the game controls and plays the same way as ac iii which to some may be a good thing i for sure liked the controls and free running of iii and very much enjoyed the combat system from iii which is also returned and slightly refined in black flag the game has a much stronger emphasis on ship combat this time as it is the major selling point of this game everything from getting money to progressing across the world is done on that damned ship to be honest the ship battles were fun at the start but they truly become grating as you progress it 's an endless grind with the ship you can 't wipe your ass with out paying 2 ,000 spanish reals and having abundant amounts of wood and metal in the damned bathroom so you can wipe your ship 's ass too it is a lot of fun to use the jackdaw later on when you 've pimped it out to near incredible stats ship boarding is also a new system in black flag and damn they are fun however just like ship battles ship boarding becomes a hassle it 's only slightly redeemed by the fact that ship boarding can grant the player loads of supplies rather efficiently ship combat can become very overwhelming even when you 're over powered large ships in a large group can and will mess you up especially in the earlier parts of the game most of the jackdaw 's and edward 's upgrades can be unlocked by getting secret blueprints across the caribbean and trust me they are the most annoying things to go out of you way to collect i also hated hunting in this game i felt it just restricted me from simply paying for an upgrade it 's an inconvenience and a forced grind freaking metal and wood farming for the jackdaw just blows but there 's lots to do in black flag too assassination contracts have returned from the older ac games and they 're rewarding there 's also fuck loads of collectibles and exploration to just be done here too gameplay 6 -10, it would be higher but the problems i 've had were far more daunting than most of the fun i 've experienced it 's still damn good fun though graphics are next assassin 's creed games have never been ugly games (with the exception of the original ac ii black flag is a wonderful example of the best of last gen graphics playing this game on high graphics is just mesmerizing from the beautiful sky boxes to the wonderful storm effects the most wonderful water graphics environments and most character models black flag just has plain beautiful graphics depending on your pc strength it may lag your computer like monster when it comes to the ship battles graphics 9 -10, definitely beautiful game sound and music in black flag i feel is just plain forgettable while the sounds of ambience and ship battles are realistic the thing is most of them are recurring noises from assassin 's creed iii and previous titles there 's not much new to the sound system as for music what music ac iv has some great battle tunes and indeed does have wonderful ambient songs playing around the cities like kingston and nassau (they're no 'home in florence or 'sanctuary'), but besides those and the wonderful ship shanties this game has a lack luster soundtrack long gone are the days of jesper kyd and his absence is evident sound and music 4 -10, a definite disappointment from a franchise that has been known for having good music in their games in conclusion assassin 's creed iv black flag is a must buy for those who are asssassin 's creed fans in the like it 's also a perfect game to get into the franchise with because it cuts off most of the old storyline from the previous games and gives gamers a fresh new canvas to enjoy it has the second biggest departure from the franchise 's established norms (the first being ac odyssey it 's a truly memorable gem that 's

       " \"*vague story spoilers continually in reviewing every successive assassin 's creed title i write that they are full of content atmosphere and potential but ultimately mediocre in writing and mechanics i usually note that there is one remarkable game out of the many games in the series one that like the others is visually beautiful possessing broad cityscapes and colorful vistas like the others the game i refer to can boast of having plentiful content in a large world it 's also got a great atmosphere and a very complementary soundtrack just like the other games unlike the others though it has writing story pacing and character development that is at least decent more open -ended stealth mechanics and considerably more complex upgrade systems giving players more reason to keep playing and stay invested that 's this game i suppose of course that i must respond to the weak and feeble objection raised against this game that it 's 'pirate's creed and not assassin 's creed which is among the more inane and irrelevant criticisms leveled at a game in my recent memory as if it were at all pertinent to the game 's overall quality to its mechanics to its storytelling to the content offered that it seemingly deviates from the other titles primary conflict theme and gameplay focus in fairness i grant that it would be pertinent if you thought that the previous titles in the series in their focus on the assassins on the templars and the thrust of the gameplay being about these concepts were anything particularly good special or even decent if you thought that (and if you do god help you then it would make sense that this game would seem like a departure from those things and not a building on or continuation of them unfortunately for this line of criticism though and like i mentioned at the outset nearly all the titles in this franchise have terribly poor writing characters and storytelling additionally the assassin /templar conflict was a totally vacuous and surprisingly weak central narrative further the stealth gameplay was fairly constrained and linear up to this point i really have no reason to go back through aci because it 's a non -functioning horrible mess of a game or ac2 /ac:b/ac:r as there aren 't many other ways to go through the games or approach the situations given to the player they all present the same atmosphere in the assassins v templar garbage and its never ever been compelling or interesting except to the edgiest of teenagers and anonymous -hopefuls. this game dared to occasionally tell other stories hear other characters show and immerse us in different worlds and surprisingly enough it was leagues more interesting and compelling than any of the other titles admittedly i find it hard not to get caught up in the whole pirate atmosphere and the image of being a fearsome scourge of the seas however apparently to some fans this is a grave unforgivable sin i hear this complaint often enough that i devoted this much to it anyway moving on (if you 're going to leave an 'b-but muhh ezio /altair' comment just stop now i don 't care bad characters bad stories at -best mediocre games more often than not this game is about a conflicted protagonist who in seeking out riches fame fortune and comfort ultimately loses people he cares about in realizing the value of those he lost his love for them he comes to a greater sense of respect care and regard for others and responsibility for the consequences of his own actions that is a meaningful story with real potential to make me care not the edgy vapid bullshit that constituted the 'narrative' in the other titles oh and i don 't have to listen to desmond 's stupid voice or look at his dumb face so there 's points already silent protagonist in an abstergo office who goes around hacking his colleagues computers and forced by the janitor to do increasingly risky tasks uncovering the conspiracy or whatever you 're working there and going through edward 's memories under the pretense of developing an entertainment game based off his pirate stories it 's nothing fantastic but is it better than desmond and his band of losers does it makes relative sense yes the story of assassins and templars is still there but it is more of a sideshow thank god than in previous games to the character 's arc and development at best it 's a helpful vehicle but only that in telling edward 's story instead of the other way around like in previous titles for the arc i just described to make sense the game had to have characters that were sufficiently developed and fleshed out themselves so that we could care about them and surprisingly enough the writers delivered moving on the gameplay is split between the traditional content featured in previous titles exploring the cities and countryside jumping from rooftop to rooftop and assassinating targets on foot the other half though is spent on your ship which has a robust upgrade tree sailing the high seas before we move on to the sailing a note about the on -foot gameplay the player is given more options in managing crowds and guards whether you 're putting them to sleep turning them against eachother or disabling their security than in previous titles revelations had a 'bomb-crafting' system that allowed for these things to an extent but it wasn 't even remotely necessary to engage with as the game was mind -numbingly easy and the bomb making was cumbersome here the game is at least challenging enough until you 've got a lot of upgrades that it pays to be a little more careful and think about your approach and the game gives you easy -to-use tools for your situation you know like in an actual stealth game your ship controls really well and the game 's system of ship levels combat and different resources and items to collect sell and use for upgrades makes for a whole world of deep gameplay that you can sink a lot of hours into your crew sing shanties which are great and of which you can collect more floating around the cities to add to your collection and the atmosphere while you 're sailing there 's plenty of sunken treasure upgrade plans collectibles and large goals to work towards all to be uncovered by exploring the large map visiting islands and cities there 's a lot of content this expansive world is a gorgeous color -saturated depiction of the caribbean what 's more to say about it it 's prettier than any of the previous titles in the series if you 're going to play an assassin 's creed game this is it this is the remarkable title in the series that stands out

       " \" one of the best pirate games ever   first of all i want to say that i played this game on the day of release on my console back then even then i fell in love with this game almost every aspect of this game is brilliant which is very funny because it was made by ubisoft who can no longer make good games i consider them degrading company    but that doesn 't mean that there aren 't any negative aspects    so let 's start with the pros  1. graphics . for 2013 they are very good  especially for game from ubisoft .  however it is also worth noting that for the pc port the graphics could have been slightly improved but this is just a port and not some kind of remaster so i won 't complain about it 2. plot . well objectively speaking it is not bad but it won 't set the world on fire either it is quite simple in some moments even clichéd but it does its job quite well many people do not like the fact that the main character is not a trained assassin , but  i 'll disagree . yes for game series about assassins it 's pretty uncommon and ridiculous but in my opinion this story shows one important detail that anyone can be an assassin and you don 't have to be super special to become one and given that at the time of the release of the game assassins were mainly striving for somewhat good goals , then such a twist may encourage the player to various actions also edward kenway is an ordinary person who wasn 't interested to save the world etc but simply strived to live the way he wants so that he doesn 't need anything he is not  ready to help everyone he meets for free he only does what suits him and what he wants this is quite common for any person and thus this plot 'twist' makes the main character more relatable about the other different plot twists and etc i perhaps won 't say anything they seem to work but not without drawbacks although the previous games in the series did not have any mind -blowing twists too so again i won 't complain about it . 3. animations effects weather conditions sea and surroundings . they are done with a bang the storm is one of my favorite events in the whole game it feels dangerous and tense it interferes with maneuvering and attacking doesn 't allow the ship to be abandoned and also creates an atmosphere and the music ( about which we will talk about in the 4th article ), adds cinematic quality and additional tension to it i would also like to note the architecture reflects that era of the 18th century really well 4. music  it is beautifully composed each track in the game has a nicely done melody and also perfectly complements different events battles stealth missions etc i loved these soundtracks so much that i even added them to my apple music .  5. battles both on land and on water  naval battles and boardings are done quite well i would even say excellently i can feel how powerful are cannons how strong is the wind how quick is my ship etc all of that adds extra immersion in the game the maneuverability of your ship and naval strategy also play an important role all of that combined works perfectly and you can feel the action especially in battles against legendary ships or fleets of 5 manowars and galleons i feel the scale of the battle and its intensity as for the battles on land there were some drawbacks here i 'll talk more about this in the cons category . 6. side quests  well there are also some drawbacks here but i would like to note that most of the missions and activities from the secondary category are done quite well they are interesting and have various awards for example whale hunting is one of my favorite gameplay elements . and templar hunts are the best side quests . they are interesting not so boring as others and also there aren 't billions of them which doesn 't make them tiresome now, let 's talk about the cons  1. console port  because of this most aspects in the game are lame graphics suffer inconvenience of controls as well as optimization the game has the stupidest limit of 60 frames because of this i still ( not only me ) had critical frames drops on my $5 ,000+ pc . ( ye idc what you will say about it name it however you want bragging or smth again idc ) there are occasional frame drops i have seen these drops more than once just over time in the game its unpredictable . this pisses me off . but its not that bad they are not that much  critcal and most of the times i needed to wait a little for fps to stabilize also, this silly integration with the ubisoft launcher also sometimes gets in the way for me . 2. parkour  in unity it is done very well but in this game and previous ones it is very inconvenient unpredictable and stupid sometimes but still it 's pretty good . 3. combat on land and stealth  let's return to this topic . although the animations are cool and badass this doesn 't prevent the gameplay from being rather boring press the left mouse button million times and occasionally do not forget to press 'e'. that's it . nothing more is required from you terrible ai makes things even worse the npcs are so dumb it 's not even funny anymore stealth aspect becomes really goofy and suffers from this combat system there is no intended punishment for the fact that you completed the mission 'loudly'. of course there will be more enemies but that 's not a big of a deal because it is enough to occasionally press 'e' and you are invulnerable even against 100 people 4. bugs  i wont talk about it so much . animation bugs not loading missions or disappearing npcs etc there aren 't much of them but they still are annoying. but, to be fair i will say that this was also in the version for consoles . 5. side quests and and how monotonous they are  go there kill that one collect all the fragments etc they are very simple and tedious btw it is very annoying that in order to complete the game 100 you have to swim through all small islands just to collect one animus fragment or one chest and game doesn 't provide anything to help you out in this situation game will park your ship 10000 miles away from island and wont give even a boat that player literally have and uses in sea hunting .  i guess that 's all i would like to say    let 's sum it up then   i think that the game is just great even almost the best in the series it has interesting plot and gameplay and also its very badass. however it also has downsides the monotony of content and poor combat system can sometimes get player bored quickly   my rating is 7 or 8 /10. definetely a must -try.  \",\n",

       " \"assassin 's creed iv is the game that assassin 's creed iii should have been you know like actually good and stuff in that way it 's somewhat similar to the drastic change in quality from ac1 to ac2 assassin 's creed iii had some good ideas including changes to the controls and overall formula but ultimately just wasn 't as good as the previous games (not to mention it was also buggy as all hell ac4 takes the improvements that ac3 tried to make and actually implements them with nary a bug in sight i suppose it also helps that the setting and main character are far more interesting as well i mean seriously who doesn 't dig pirates and adventure on the high seas you play as privateer edward kenway neither assassin nor templar thrust into the middle of both of those worlds edward is one of the better protagonists in the series and is generally quite likeable the one huge difference that sets black flag apart from previous games in the series is its setting well over half the game takes place on the ocean and what an ocean it is seriously it is huge and sailing on it is just so very cool the closest comparison i can make is to exploring the ocean in the wind waker on gamecube back in the day only much bigger and more realistic the exploration element alone is great however what really sets ac4 apart is the way it looks and feels in terms of video game technology it 's just amazing what they were able to pull off you can almost actually feel like you 're out on the ocean as waves and wind make your ship swerve sway and dip (and just wait until you see all the gorgeous weather effects i can 't imagine any game ever nailing seafaring better than this (well, at least not until virtual reality sailing comes along it just feels great naval combat also plays a big part in the game unfortunately as fun as it can be it does have a few problems you control your weapons by changing the perspective of the camera (look to the ship 's side to fire cannons or to the rear to drop fire barrels for example this is all well and good in theory but in the heat of battle with multiple enemies it can get a bit dodgy by the end of the game you should have a good handle on it but it isn 't always the easiest thing to manage by far the coolest part of combat is boarding other ships there are no loading screens on the ocean ever this means that any ship you see (and all of the crew members on it can be engaged in real time at any time if you want to jump off your ship and swim to a frigate and kill every dude on board all by yourself you can do that if you want to incapacitate a ship with your cannons get alongside board it by swinging on a rope and air -assassinating the captain from one of the masts you can do that it is very very fun but as with anything repetition will eventually cool those initial highs and you may start to tire of the whole process by the time the latter parts of the game roll along this is more an inevitability than a knock on the game itself but should be mentioned rounding out the new additions to the series black flag introduces a set of underwater diving locations these are mostly optional and don 't really make or break the game one way or the other they are just 'meh', mostly due to the horrible controls inherent with underwater segments in every game with underwater segments ever made ever there are some cool bits underwater but these segments could have easily been excluded and it still would have been a decent game the other half of the game takes place in land -based locations and follows the standard ac series formula you take on various missions to gather information or assassinate people which require either stealth combat or both free -running and climbing also return and are generally ok though the usual issues (like climbing onto things you aren 't trying to climb onto in the heat of the moment are still ocasionally present combat is similar to previous games as well mostly all you need to do is button mash and use counters or break enemy defenses at the appropriate moments as simple as it is it is still ever so satisfying due to the insane number of moves you can pull off in various situations put simply you are a serious badass there is also a very limited number of different weapons available (contrary to previous games which is a welcome change there 's no longer 3 inventory screens worth of pointless weapons you 'll never use early on you 'll be able to buy a good set of swords and pistols those along with your hidden blades are pretty much all you 'll ever want or need for the majority of the game the land -based segments take place in 3 major locations havana nassau and kingston additionally there are a number of smaller islands scattered around the ocean that contain fishing villages ruins and more overall it 's a nice balance between traditional ac and the newer naval bits the last part of the package is a sub -plot that continues the goings -on in the modern -day time period with desmond out of the picture (mostly), you play as an unnamed employee in the game division of the abstergo corporation i don 't mind these sections too much but for those of you who don 't care about these present -day bits just know that most of these sections are optional and the parts that are required can be done pretty quickly the optional activities available involve 'hacking' a bunch of computers which unlocks various bits of lore and info on what has happened since the events of the previous game if you are into following that part of the series some of it is pretty interesting otherwise these optional bits can simply be ignored overall i found this to be a worthy entry in a series i thought was on its last (peg?) legs the amount of things to do is pretty insane and i found almost everything to be pretty dang fun that said i am also somewhat easy to please and kind of anal when it comes to games that have any kind of collecting aspect so take that opinion for what it 's worth a lot of how much you enjoy this game will depend on how much you dig the new seafaring aspect since it is such a large portion of the experience i can see how it might be hit or miss for some people if you liked the naval missions in ac3 then you will most definitely enjoy the improvements black flag makes in that area if you hated those missions i hesitate to recommend ac4 wholeheartedly (though you very well may still enjoy it if you 've never played an ac game before or haven 't played one in a long time this is a great one to jump into the series with it 's definitely not perfect but it 's pretty solid overall i 'd rank it up there with the better games in the ac2 era i 'd give it a b or a\",\n",
       " \"basically traditional assassin 's creed game with ship battle very detailed world and interesting character ships are a very good addition to the game but it can get repetitive and grindy but it 's interesting to have both naval battle and land battle which make the game more interesting some bugs are seldom present throughout the game but it doesn 't affect the game in general the only major flaw in this game would be the story most if not all of the 'main' characters are very well developed but they just disappear during the story or somehow managed to die so i end up with some other characters that i meet in the middle of the game and they are not properly introduced and developed\",\n",

       " \"black flag was the first game i ever 'reviewed' on my steam account and as such i didn 't give it any real justice black flag is herald as one if not the best of the series and for good reason it brings us an interesting protagonist with solid naval gameplay it has its drawbacks sure but it ultimately turns into a wonderful experience all around i 'm not usually keen on playing 'yet another white male but edward 's depth really sold me on him he has a perfectly understandable outlook of 'i want walls that hold back the wind and cold i want food that doesn 't taste like dust this is not an exact quote as i 'm reinstalling after probably a year since i 've played it last but that is effectively his motive to not be poor this leads him to the pirate life (or 'privateers' as he tries to convince his girlfriend that going away for a year is what 's best for them and further leads into his snarky devil -may-care attitude he gets plenty of dialog that shows the full gamut of personality that involves greed fear worry confusion and bravery this is how you write a character people the game does not waste time getting edward in his own ship with mechanics you might recall were tapped into in ac3 but never utilized and was mostly stuck in an optional gimmick it returns here in full blast with solid broadside mechanics that eventually turn into a melee as you render enemy ships inert you follow through on a couple of objectives and call it a victory it 's one of my favorite aspects of the game and even includes a sort of ship -based stealth mission or two as you try to navigate your ship through swamps avoid massive man o war 's, and risk exploring contested waters if there 's a drawback it 's that the game focuses so much on the naval combat (which, again is wonderful that the on -foot missions suffer greatly most of them involve following a mark around and staying within an audio bubble to hear them properly they are frequently irritating and not as interesting as the more straightforward assassinations that the series is known for for those who felt the 'modern day segments were a blight they thankfully take more of a backseat here you step into the role of a voiceless employee that navigate the headquarters on your off -time and suss out the secrets of the company ultimately you are whomever you wish to be and exploring is largely optional as most of the time you can just 'log back in and go straight back into the game proper regardless of one 's opinion on ubisoft and recent business practices i highly recommend you get this game even if you 're not a fan of the franchise black flag stands on its own two feet and you won 't need to know a lot of lore to be invested in edward 's personal journey please get this game\",\n",

       " 'assassin’s creed iv black flag ’s unique focus on naval combat really sets it apart from previous entries in the franchise however a lot of technical problems really ruin what would otherwise be quite an enjoyable pirate experience  after naval combat was introduced in assassin’s creed iii  (the best part of the entire game for many ubisoft made the right decision for once and doubled down on the entire thing in the sequel black flag . with the appropriate setting pirates in the caribbean of course black flag  had a lot of potential to be a great game even for those who are not a fan of the typical assassin’s creed  formula and even though i played through all mainline assassin’s creed  up until that point i actually found the first few hours of black flag  surprisingly refreshing in the beginning it ’s really fun to sail the caribbean sea with your own pirate ship discovering new locations and engaging with other enemy ships in combat to steal their cargo you then turn your cargo into ship upgrades which allow you to take on even bigger challenges (read: bigger ships for bigger rewards during these times black flag  feels less like an assassin’s creed  games and more like an entertaining -albeit-simple pirate spectacle naval combat isn ’t very complex and your ship upgrades will play a bigger part in surviving a battle than your reaction skills at the end but it ’s simple fun the first few times and a great visual spectacle this goes especially for ship battles fought during heavy tropical storms with big waves heavy rain and a lot of thunder lightning making for incredible memorable battle experiences however as the game goes on and especially during story missions the usual assassin’s creed  elements become more prevalent you ’ll spend more time on land than on water visiting locations that unfortunately all look pretty similar to each other even those not part of the caribbean sea once you ’re on land you also got the usual assassin’s creed -mix of assassinating certain targets tailing people collecting various side stuff and climbing towers to unveil the map little has changed here making it a typical case of “you’ll like it if you liked it before and you ’ll dislike it if you disliked it before in fact even though naval combat plays such a big role in black flag , at the end i was surprised just how many of the usual assassin’s creed  strengths weaknesses make a return there ’s a huge amount of content but much of it feels like busy work or copy -pasted. gameplay systems are easy to understand use but they lack depth variety and thus get tiresome in the long run and while the main story does have its moments many characters remain underdeveloped and the pacing is off i do have to admit that i liked the abstergo -elements of the story this time around even if the ending was unsatisfyingly abrupt in the end what was a fun pirate game in the beginning turned more into a usual assassin’s creed  game along the way we even got ship tailing missions which is just going too far but while the usual assassin’s creed  mix might have its fair share of problems it ’s undeniable that it also has its charm and there ’s nothing quite like it even to this day that said i will have to spend the rest of the review detailing the numerous technical problems i encountered while playing black flag . these are also the main reason why i ’m giving black flag  a negative review as they ’re heavily diminishing what would otherwise be an enjoyable pirate assassin’s creed  experience i have no idea if these problems are restricted to the steam /pc version of the game but if you want to play the game you might be better off doing so on console the first issues i encountered concern the graphical settings of the game for some reason black flag  simply refused to offer a 1440p 60hz option for my main monitor it did offer all other resolutions at 60hz but not 1440p for some reason if i changed this via the settings .ini file the game simply ignored those changes if i tried using other monitors the 1440p 60hz option suddenly reappeared it ’s quite an odd problem i wasn ’t able to solve (had to use a different resolution and have never experienced with any other game before (even cyberpunk 2077 the next issue concerns game content i originally bought the game back in 2019 first the standard edition and then the season pass afterwards however when i started black flag  for the first time just a few days ago and activated my key i found out that i wasn ’t able to access my season pass content everything i paid for didn ’t show up instead i just received ads for buying said content adding insult to injury i ’ve spent the past few days contacting ubisoft support about the issue but so far it has yet to be solved as well then came what ’s probably the biggest gripe i have concerning black flag  after about 15h of playtime i opened up the game only to find out that my save was suddenly corrupted even ubisoft connect with its cloud saves couldn ’t help me out (it simply replaced my functioning save with the corrupt one i have no idea what could ’ve caused this as the game never crashed on me or was forcefully exited neither was the save data tempered with i started the game normally only to discover i lost 15h of playtime with no way to get it back everything i did was gone i highly recommend manually backing up your saves (steam cloud doesn ’t work for this game if you still fancy a playthrough of black flag  on steam lastly there were some game breaking bugs i encountered while playing black flag . i ’m not talking about minor bugs like this classic (which i also experienced but actual gamebreakers that require a reload if you want to finish a mission for example one time my player character spawned inside my pirate ship with no way to experience the wooden prison this would be somewhat entertaining if the checkpoints in black flag  weren ’t so bad sometimes especially during tailing missions you might lose quite a lot of time maybe i just had bad luck with all of these technical problems happening at once (not counting the many minor bugs like glitching npcs etc but especially losing a 15h save really turned my playthrough of black flag  into an experience i can ’t really recommend even if the underlying game would be recommendation -worthy otherwise considering black flag  is also available on modern consoles these might be safer picks if you want to avoid some of these technical problems',\n",

       " \"black flag is a bit of an oddity in the assassin 's creed franchise it 's difficult to say if it 's a good assassin 's creed game because it is quite a bit different both thematically and mechanically than it 's predecessors fortunately this is actually very good thing in a franchise that has seen a bit of a decline in terms of quality over the years at the very least i will say that this is the best pirate themed game that i 've ever played as well as one of my favourite games flat out first things first this game just oozes atmosphere the locations you get to visit are all interesting aesthetically as well as being quite varied from one another there 's a pirate cove full of debauchary and friends there 's english and spanish colonies independant islands and small stretches of land barely big enough to walk on the great design choice is the fact that you don 't spend the game in a couple of cities you spend it exploring the journey between all of the story specific islands and landmasses is genuinely entertaining because the world is a such a joy to explore it 's not just a case of the graphics being good (which they certainly are it 's the fact that the world is very nicely crafted and a lot of detail has been added in the way in which you move through the world is twofold you sail around the world in your ship or you leave the ship and wander about doing the various story and side missions scattered around the world you are somewhat stopped from simply going wherever you want by the game placing much more difficult to defeat ships in some of the locations you are meant to visit later on in the game theoretically you could just take these down but it 's more likely you would get absolutely trashed i won 't complain about this as an artificial way of stopping you from doing whatever you please because it makes sense from a narritive point of view the bigger ships protect the more lucrative trade routes and areas the absolute best part of this game however is undoubtedly the ship itself the jackdaw your home for the game and where the real pirating is done after a brief period of adjusting to the controls of the ship it becomes second nature to be behind it 's wheel the game is just oozing in theme and the ship is no exception your trusty crew will sing sea shanties as you sail around and you 'll soon find your favourite ones and have them memorised upgrading the jackdaw over time is an entertaining distraction and once you reach the upper echelons of the upgrade tree you 'll really notice the difference in power you can customise aspects of it such as the prow the sails and the interior to your liking the ship combat is very robust and i didn 't find myself bored of raiding other ships even towards the end of my playthrough you sometimes find yourself in combat with two or even three larger ships and the hectic nature of battles in the high seas really shines through it 's especially satisfying blasting a full broadside and watching another ship begin to sink of course this is a pirate game so after weakening an enemy ship you have the option to board it during which you will engage the enemy in hand to hand combat as as assassin you will always have the upper hand in the melee but your crew will be helping you out as well one of my few complaints about the game is that boarding can become quite tedious you are expected to kill a certain amount of the enemy ship 's crew before they surrender their cargo but on the bigger ships this often ends up being 25 kills when you 're already fighting multiple ships and you have to do this two or three times it can become somewhat irritating upon capturing enemy ships you have 3 options patch up your own ship reduce your wanted level or add them to your own fleet your wanted level increases the more ships you loot or sink in a short period of time and progressively stronger bounty hunters will head your way actively seeking you out wherever you happen to be with the intention of taking you out it 's pretty easy to reduce but it 's a cool little mechanic as for sending ships to your own fleet this game introduces a little minigame where you can send your own fleet of ships on missions to earn you resources which can be used to upgrade your own ships it takes a little while to get used to but it can be a fun distraction though i wouldn 't say it 's really necessary to do perhaps just a time saver if you really want rarer resources quicker if i was being cynical it feels like ubisoft wanted this to be a game you play all the time because the bigger missions take 9 hours (real time not playtime to complete which is a bit ridiculous if you 're like me and marathon games that being said i did have fun with the fleet system and capturing bigger ships to add to your fleet is a nice distraction the story follows edward kenway 's progression from pirate to assassin with some interesting characters along the way such as blackbeard and mary read at the same time it does continue the story from the previous games of course this is another story of the battle between assassins and templars but i actually felt motivated to do a lot of the missions because i was doing them for other pirates i feel like edward 's motivation to become an asssassin is credible and believable as he learns various lessons throughout his journey in the game that convinces him he needs to follow a better path the story overall is fun if a little short i feel like how much you care about the story would affect your enjoyment of the game somewhat i didn 't really care too much about the assassin /templar thing but it drew me in towards the end of the game you are using an animus throughout the game with the motivation being that you are working for a company trying to make a pirate game using the memories of kenway this takes place in the offices of abstergo and you 're able to wander about the offices to find some nice tidbids and story pieces from the previous games there 's a really cool twist at the end as well if you blast through the main story it probably won 't take you very long but if you 're like me and you mix in the main story with exploring you can greately extend the amount of time you play there 's some cool little things to do on the side hunting is one of the standout features in particular hunting whales and other large sea creatures unfortunately without properly upgrading your harpoon it 's very hard to actually catch any of them you can use the pelts /materials of the animals you hunt for gear and to upgrade edward 's abilities as well you can use treasure maps to find hidden booty find pieces of sheet music to add to your list of sea shanties and various other distractions my favourite part is that you can go underwater in a diving bell and feel the fear of hiding from sharks while you look for treasure the biggest problem is that you have to use uplay which is third party drm within the drm which is steam already thankfully i had no issues with this but a lot of people have had very negative experiences with it finally i feel i have to talk about the musical score the music really is incredible at capturing the atmosphere of the game and there are some truly memorable pieces which i still listen to from time to time the sea shanties are excellently done and make you feel like you 're really part of the crew overall this game is amazing it 's almost a shame that 's it 's an assassin 's creed game because at times i felt like it could have been something much more if it wasn 't shackled into the franchise with certain expectations and necessities being in the game the feeling of freedom and joy sailing around the map is an unforgettable experience for me and i can 't recommend this game enough perhaps it 's not the assassin 's creed you 're used to but i feel like that 's a really good thing\",\n",

changed my fate i thought i would join the navy and pursue these pirates around the world but i was wrong i was born in nassau and even though my parents were ordinary people i still shed the blood of pirates all of this is because i was born in nassau i started stealing and used the stolen money to exchange for rum at anne 's tavern this is pirate money and it 's not clean either let 's use this money to help me the poor man to this day i still remember the first time i saw that man his body was even bigger than a black beard and the moment i reached into his waist bag the tip of the knife was already on my neck but his double swords were clearly shining with a terrifying cold light on his waist kid this little money is making you crazy 'he took off his hood it 's a pirate material would you like to be a buddy for my jackdaw i just saw his outfit clearly he didn 't wear a captain 's hat but covered the upper half of his face with a hood although his beard was shaky his blonde hair was meticulously combed and his clothes were not as easy to move as other pirates but more like a long robe leather armor protected his chest wrists and shoulders and his wrists looked particularly thick his chest was like the legendary pirate 's black beard hanging four handguns my name is edward 'he continued it 's not edward teach it 's edward kenway from now on i 'll be your captain this may be my chance to avenge myself i will follow him to the sea and find that group of disloyal and unjust pirates captain kenway is completely different from the pirates i have seen he seems very indifferent to money and the money and goods from the robbery are distributed to us he is always staring at a map he is even more terrifying than ordinary pirates i have never seen more than a dozen pirates that the british people cannot deal with sometimes with just a gentle punch the british sailor falls down in pain and blood he is no different from ordinary pirates and he will not let go of the ships in his sight whether navy merchants or bounty hunters he is very different from other pirates never passing by and always looking east he often talks about 'the wealth that cannot be spent in a lifetime listening to chief officer advall saying that it is a place called the 'observatory', where captain kenway has been longing for the treasure since he set sail on a very ordinary day the jackdaw stayed near cape guarico and the caribbean sun was still scorching mixed with the salty taste of the sea making me feel dull and suffocating i was dozing off on the deck of the jackdaw when the first mate suddenly shouted 'yang fan set sail but i didn 't see captain kenway so the jackdaw departed and no one knew where captain kenway had gone except for advall the jackdaw set sail again and in half a year we sailed across the caribbean sea i met legendary captains from all walks of life snatched various gold and silver treasures told women my adventure stories used my fists to teach gangsters a lesson and even found a group of disloyal and unjust pirates personally cutting off their captains heads but i still haven 't seen captain kenway but he wouldn 't just disappear on the sea like this even if blackbeard died he wouldn 't die because it was real so he appeared and six months later on another scorching day i met him at anne 's tavern i watched him and anne walk from the tavern to the beach from a distance on the deck and chief officer advall walked towards them from the ship hugging captain kenway although i couldn 't hear their conversation clearly but there is a sentence that i am deeply impressed with and still cannot understand everything is empty all actions are allowed from that day on advall left the jackdaw and anne became the new mate i still live the days of burning killing and looting but the captain seems to have become less greedy when he talks about the observation post his eyes also change no longer yearning for endless wealth his eyes seem to see other things that have surpassed the understanding of pirates i have completed my revenge but i want to know what he is longing for on this day we arrived at cape guarico again with the scorching sun shining on the deck of the jackdaw the salty taste of the sea became even stronger as if it would reappear some day six months ago but this time the captain came out covered in blood and without treasure but he revealed joy that i had never seen before let 's go home and invite everyone to drink this is the coldest banquet we have ever had and the big pirates are not here annie is singing and captain kenway is toasting to the empty seats reserved for the captains as if they are all there he burst into tears but he had never laughed so happily before this scene makes me feel very sad but i don 't understand whether the captain is crying or laughing a sailor rushed from the dock and whispered a few words in the captain 's ear the captain widened his eyes and looked at him even rum fell to the ground the wind stopped and anne 's singing stopped abruptly the crew watched the captain as if the world had stopped moving forward after a while the captain casually wiped his face and fumbled for something he took off his pistol took off his double knives took off his never taken off wrist guard pursed his golden hair and quickly walked towards the dock annie also chased after him by the time we arrived at the dock he had already squatted on the shore holding a few fresh wild flowers in his hand and a little girl stood in front of him i saw the captain so humble for the first time and finally understood what the east he was looking at was since that day the jackdaw has become a legend in the caribbean and no one has ever seen edward kenway and his beloved jackdaw again i am very happy i am a pirate under edward kenway\",\n",

       " \"a pirates life for me the assassin ’s creed series hasn ’t changed much since it ’s holy -war debut back in 2007 ubisofts signature blend of parkour /stealth gameplay framed by a compelling and often kojima -esque meta -narrative is a formula which has never needed much improvement but each addition to the series has built on its predecessor adding interesting new mechanics and hooks (i’m looking at you revelations to help keep things fresh black flag places you in the recently liberated boots of captain edward kenway a rough round the edges loveable rogue with a quick wit and one thing on his mind treasure and whist templar conspiracies and secret wars with assassins are rife in the vast caribbean ocean kenway ’s only interested in such affairs for as long as they 're profitable to that end black flag positively encourages exploration and adventure to the point where the main story quickly becomes a secondary concern which isn ’t to say it ’s not worth playing through in fact black flag ’s main narrative is arguably one of the strongest in the franchise the overall tone is light and humorous (certainly in comparison to the sombre quest -for-revenge that was aciii and there ’s not a single character amongst the myriad cast of famous -named swashbucklers that doesn ’t feel fleshed -out and well characterised the game also offers an overwhelming number of side activities to indulge in and keep you occupied many we ’ve already seen in previous ‘creeds’, but some welcome themed additions to the roster include whaling diving hunting for mayan treasure and battling with the caribbean ’s 4 ‘legendary’ enemy ships but trust me when i say leave fighting them until your endgame the huge world map is revealed incrementally as you travel from island to island and large sections are filled in with the successful takeovers of heavily guarded forts these effectively act as synchronisation points for the overworld map highlighting nearby towns islands and explorable shipwrecks as well as a plethora of other pirate collectables and it ’s well worth taking to time to collect them building materials and plans are needed to upgrade and customise the jackdaw and you ’ll need plenty of reyals to kit kenway out with new gear if you want to stand a chance late in the game you ’ll soon find however that some of black flags most enjoyable moments come from travelling between the caribbean ’s various points of interest naval combat has been refined and perfected from its role as a side -quest in aciii and now features the ability to board and takeover enemy ships the feeling of broadsiding a british man -o-war in the middle of a typhoon before swinging onto the deck and wreaking havoc with a bandolier full of flintlocks is one that ’s seriously hard to beat throw in a heroic hollywood -esque score (composed by iron man 3s brian tyler and you ’ve got an experience as close to being in a pirates of the caribbean film as you could ever hope for even out of combat the sounds of the ocean distant cannon -fire and sea -shanties chorused by the jackdaw ’s crew make for a scenic and atmospheric ride although your ships ability to magically vacuum up any floating loot and sailors that drift by does little for the immersion of course the games various glitches and bugs don ’t help much either all too often your high -profile free -run controls will send you jumping sideways onto a path you didn ’t necessarily want to go down and a .i musketeers have an unerring ability to hit you even when you ’re behind cover but these are minor issues in an engine that ’s otherwise seriously impressive in short assassin ’s creed black flag is a tremendous technical achievement and arguably the best in the series to date stunning visuals impressive sound design and fast -paced, free -flow combat make for an engaging and immersive experience upgrading the jackdaw and kenway adds a satisfying rpg element and there ’s some excellent scope for customisation the story is well paced and quick to get going although certain mission types soon start to feel repetitive but if and when you get bored there ’s always something else to do whether that ’s hunting elusive white whales to craft kenways next costume or trying to unearth buried treasure with only a hand -scrawled map for direction the important thing is that you have the freedom to choose and surely that ’s what being pirates all about well that and treasure yo ho\",\n",

their ancestor desmond miles most of the game took place in the past but you were actually desmond reliving those lives in the near -future of our modern day via a device called the animus assassin 's creed ii was also the beginning of ubisoft settling into annual release pace with the franchise acii was followed by assassin 's creed brotherhood a title that continued ezio 's story perfected the formula and still stands as one of the high points in the franchise 2011 saw the release of assassin 's creed revelations which was a rough end to ezio 's life while acii and ac :b felt fresh and innovative revelations was a bit of a retread and new mechanics like hideout sieges didn 't feel like they fit within the series the franchise didn 't completely fall over but the momentum was slowed 2012 moved from ezio 's tale to a pair of adventures in early colonial america assassin 's creed iii and assassin 's creed iii liberation while the latter was a spin -off title built for the playstation vita the former represented the first real sequel in three years ezio was replaced with connor a half -english, half -mohawk warrior with ties to both the assassins and templars ubisoft moved to the new anvilnext engine for the game connor could climb trees and sail in the atlantic in a pair of series firsts aciii also saw the end of desmond 's tale in an ignoble demise unfortunately it was an uneven experience it wasn 't horrible but it didn 't live up to the pedigree of assassin 's creed brotherhood for some a year later the playstation 3 and xbox 360 were on the way out being replaced that year by the playstation 4 and xbox one it 's worth stepping back for a second to realize that ubisoft had released five assassin 's creed games within the same generation assassin 's creed assassin 's creed ii assassin 's creed brotherhood assassin 's creed revelations and assassin 's creed iii all launched on the playstation 3 and xbox 360 (a pc release wasn 't always a given usually quite delayed when it did happen assassin 's creed iv black flag was a trailblazer though it was launching on the playstation 3 and xbox 360 like its predecessors but it would also see a playstation 4 and xbox one release a month later for the first time ubisoft had the chance to bridge the gap between consoles black flag was still an assassin 's creed game but it left the land -based shenanigans behind for a high seas adventure edward kenway —the grandfather of assassin 's creed iii 's connor —wasn't a hero or even a member of the assassin brotherhood he was a pirate that stole the outfit for personal gain edward hobnobbed through the caribbean during the golden of age of piracy counting blackbeard mary read anne bonny and charles vane as friends and contemporaries he had that same cocksure swagger present in ezio 's first outing there 's a moment when black flag falls into place for me edward is doing the assassin thing climbing buildings running through alleys and shanking guards with his hidden blade but then you decide it 's time for a change in scenery edward goes sprinting down to where his ship the jackdaw is waiting your boots land on the deck and you just begin sailing it 's a seamless experience jumping from land to the high seas assassin 's creed iii featured on -ship segments but they were separate from the main game here both ideas are joined in a single core and it just works you were always free to go wherever in assassin 's creed that 's part of the idea of the open -world. but this jump from terra firma to the deep blue sea it feels freeing there 's a sense of exploration and freedom borne of the fictional idea of pirates a concept forged by classic pulp serials and television shows like captain blood (featuring errol flynn sinbad the sailor treasure island captain kidd and the buccaneers black flag offers up that feeling in a way that honestly no other game has before or since it 's a great assassin 's creed game but at points you can see the traditional assassin 's creed side straining under the weight of years of development assassination and stealth were solid and strong but instant fail tracking missions glitches and the lack of an easy way to get down from high places without killing yourself were all missteps to be clear these were issues carried forward from the best games in the series they just continued to haunt the franchise none of that matters though because the stuff on land worked well enough the stuff on the high sea was sublime and the gulf between the two was non -existent. nothing was holding you back to use part of the series catchphrase everything is permitted go find some unexplored islands go destroy and pillage some ships take up an assassination contract that 'll see you chasing one target from land to sea swing from your mast by a ropeline and dive into the crystal clear ocean that 'crystal clear was also a big part of black flag 's charm the game looked good on the last generation of consoles but jump to playstation 4 and xbox one offered such a vibrant and beautiful world to explore the detail put into the wood canvas and ropes of the jackdaw and other ships the waves and sea spray as your ship cut through the ocean or the massive waves of a vicious storm of particular joy to me is just sitting in the mix between ocean and land on the beaches there was water lapping at your feet the gorgeous shallows a few feet in one direction and jungle plants waving in the breeze in the other and beyond that the signs of civilization black flag stands above the best of the series is because it carries forward what assassin 's creed ii and assassin 's creed brotherhood did well while also forging new ground for the franchise edward kenway is as charming as ezio in his own way and his journey from opportunist to heroic outlaw is a good one stealth and climbing remains as solid as it was in the past entries the caribbean offered ubisoft a chance at a bit more color than the darker american revolution and moving to the next generation of consoles meant it looked amazing black flag was even so good that it may have ruined the franchise for some folks those who simply want another pirate game instead of one involving the assassins and it still holds up i may miss parkour down (introduced in unity but assassin 's creed iv black flag is still a high point in my playstation 4 library for me it 's the best in the series followed closely by assassin 's creed brotherhood assassin 's creed origins has the chance to repeat the feat coming from the same creative director as black flag and showing players the beginning of the assassin brotherhood\",\n",

       " \"i feel like this game is a love it or hate it kind of game i always see such high praise about it but i myself feel no love for 95 of the game i 'll explain why with some minor spoilers ahead so i 've played all the past ac games and enjoy the gameplay the first time i can remember experiencing something in an ac game i didn 't particularly enjoy was the ship tutorial in ac3 i hated that segment and was very glad it was optional to use the ship throughout the game unfortunately i went into ac4 thinking that the ship would be optional it most definitely wasn 't. i knew the game dealt with piracy but for some reason didn 't look up just how much of the gameplay was based on the ship but because it 's such a big part of the game it made me dislike the game if i 'm on land for a huge portion of time then yay fun times when i have to board the jackdaw and i don 't have fast travel unlocked for wherever i have to go groooooooan so needless to say i did as little ship play as possible and avoided upgrading it as much as possible also your crew sings sea shanties not necessarily a bad thing until you 've a heard that one particular song too many times or b been stuck on this one part for too long and that one jerk starting up a shanty nearly every time you return to checkpoint is pushing you over the edge luckily you can tell them to shut up which i didn 't realize until late in my playthrough i dislike the main mechanic but aside from that i wasn 't too fond of the story you play as edward kenway who is a pirate who wants to be rich he 's obsessed with scoring a big stash of gold to support his girl back home who didn 't want him to leave in the first place that 's really all there is to this character to me he wasn 't likeable and the story all revolved around him needing money so much even the more interesting characters in the game are sidelined while he goes hunting some big score for a series that delves into history so much and introduces you to so many intersting characters i feel they fell kind of short here but that (much like my strong hatred of the ship battles is obviously just my opinion otherwise the game is what you 'd expect from ac there 's hunting back again from ac3 combat is similar to previous games weapons from previous games etc if you 've played ac you know what you 're getting into and there 's nothing really stand out here so if you 're looking for a pirate game where you can sail around and have giant ship battles and plundering booty this is a good game for you if you want to play ac but also want to be a pirate you 're in luck if you 're like me and you hated the ship gameplay in three i 'd avoid this one (and ac rogue\",\n",
       " \"okay just to start off this game requires uplay i know thats an issue for some people so take that as you will anyway more imprtantly to the game itself and i was quite happy to find there 's been an improvement over the last couple of ac games particularly the awful ac3 in this game you play edward kenway who 's a pirate in the carribbean and it makes for a great setting and experience edward is the best lead character since ezio and is a likeable guy with plenty of personality the games setting is fantastic as well with loads of beautiful tropical environments with the oppurunity to sail around the carribbean and explore you 've got havana ,nassau and kingston as your 3 main cities though these are a bit dissappointing particularly nassau and kingston as they are pretty unimpressive compared to some of the great cities of the older games as for the gameplay it 's also improved all the pirate stuff you can do like attack and board ships and sail around looking for treasure is a lot of fun the assassin stuff almost feels boring in comparision there is also a lot of 'follow' missions in this game as i 've always hated these missions the most in ac games and this one is littered with them that said there still is a lot to do and explore and you will get your moneys worth from this game surprisingly the music in this game is probably one of the best parts of this game as you sail your crew will sing sea shanties which is brilliant and really gives it that pirate atmosphere i 've found myself humming the tunes after playing you can also collect more shanties which will be unlocked for your crew to sing the good great interesting protaganist in edward kenway and a few more interesting characters as well all the pirate activities are a lot of fun the carribbean looks great in this game and you 've a big area to travel and explore in -the music in this game is brilliant the bad -the story isn 't particularly interesting and a bit hard to follow at times the assassin stuff is pretty boring and there 's way too many 'follow' missions -controls still feel awkward and fiddly at times -game can be fairly buggy at times overall this is a step in the right direction again for the ac series and probably my favourite since ac2 it gets an 8 /10 from me\",\n",

       " \"after a short wait with ubisoft increasing the assassin 's creed model to one game every holiday season assassin 's creed iv black flag comes out the gates as one of the strongest ac games released since the original dropped back in 2006 i 'll keep my review short as i don 't believe words can replicate or convey my feelings and opinions about this game adequately gameplay without a doubt the strongest and weakest of the franchise thus far the variety in naval land and underwater allows the player to never feel as if they 're repeating the same thing over and over which was a major downfall of assassin 's creed 3 and the weakest entry of the series thus far ubisoft could very well have taken out templars and assassin 's, renamed the game pirates and it would stood on it 's own as a solid ip from ubisoft with that being said having black flag considered an entry in the ac franchise harms a few things swordplay is still pitiful in terms of complexity and effort with the same mindless mashing of x to slaughter endless hordes of templars being intact once again collecting is a tad bit more tedious now but this is something to expect from a game that is next -gen along with being on sea as well as land controls black flag is going to be marked as the buggiest and most frustrating ac game so far ubisoft has yet to figure out how to polish the climbing of this game back to how effective it was in ac2 automating the climbing makes navigating ships more difficult than it was in ac3 (which was already a buggy mess on it 's own and the increased number of actual ledges ropes and trees to climb only amplifies how painful it is to navigate on land and sea effectively but if we turn our eyes towards ship and sea controls this is a gigantic step forward from ac3 the expanded arsenal that edward has available at his disposal along with the seamless selection of weapons makes naval combat a matter of quick thinking and timing rather than jumping through a thousand control hoops i never had to think about which weapon i was using only to gage where my ship was relative to the target and i instantly knew what i had to use and how to use it ubisoft also expanded ship controls beyond combat adding in a travel speed that allows a more relaxing cinematic perspective while sailing the high seas alone on top of this designating one button to dock release and board makes it simple to understand what you want to do at any time story while black flag will never hold a candle to how tighly wound ezio 's initial storyline was in ac2 or the simplicity that we had in ac1 edward 's tale is cleaner more entertaining and enjoyable than any moment conner 's story ever had to offer before you ever take on the robes of the assassin 's, you can feel haytham 's energy pouring out of edward but with more purpose and context playing edward makes it easy to see why we enjoyed haytham so much and why conner was such a disappointment in comparison the continuation of desmond 's story is hard to care about as black flag has a massive disconnect with desmond for much of the story and leaves us wanting more i do hope ubisoft returns to the idea of a modern day ac entry as desmond 's sequences in ac3 felt more difficult and stressful as you are without the animus ui to guide you you like desmond had to adapt to the enviroment and think on your feet instead of being given indicators and waypoints overall if you were worried about black flag after how disasterous ac3 was like myself do not fret black flag is easily the best entry since assassin 's creed 2 and serves to allow ubisoft to go in different directions with a new ip using the naval gameplay of black flag along with pushing us closer to more modern day entries in the franchise edward is what we 've always wanted from an ac protagonist full of character rich with dialogue and meaning and complexity that allows you to believe that what edward is doing is what he wants to do instead of being shoved into his role like conner and ezio gameplay 9 /10 controls 7 /10 story 7 .5/10 overall 8 .25\",\n",

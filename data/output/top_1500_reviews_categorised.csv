"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",this is the best assassins creed game and probably the best pirate game ever
['no topic'],best game ever iv 'e been playing from day one (love it and i 'm 75 years young arrrrr matey
['pirate theme'],shanties before panties
"['pirate theme', 'music']",best part of the game are the sea shanties lowkey 1700 's jams be poppin
"['graphics', 'combat', 'difficulty', 'uplay', 'cloud mechanics']",pros -beautiful graphics -huge artistic work -vast world -naval battles are awesomeeeee -main quest is captivating cons -uplay -same old basic combat system -lack of difficulty -little to no changes in gameplay compared to the older acs -uplay -uplay -seriously... uplay advice disable cloud save sync i lost 15 hours of gameplay because of that idiotic setting and you can avoid that by simply disabling cloud sync
"['assassin theme', 'combat', 'stealth', 'exploration', 'storyline', 'character', 'graphics', 'optimization', 'uplay']",the best assassin 's creed game since assassin 's creed 2 this is coming from someone who hates pirates this game comes in three parts being a assassin being a ship captain and being a ubi i mean abstergo employee the assassin part is similar to the previous games but it is improved sword fighting feels alot better than previous games its more batman -like (arkham games and less counter -kill spam range weapons are powerful but not over powered they finally put stealth mechanics in the game a game about assassins (you can hide in bushes long grass and are able to move around mission design is really good and more varied than previous games side missions are amazing too they range from under -sea diving to whaling to taking over forts being a ship captain is the best part of the game i enjoyed exploring the high seas more than the storyline i kept exploring till the point where all that i could was the main storyline your ship is upgradable and the system is extensive ship combat is great it consists of shooting cannons at each other and then boarding for some sword fighting to capture the ship its really addicting being a ubisoft employee is in first person and you mainly do hacking puzzels in it doing these puzzels unlocks background information that is really interesting multiplayer haven 't touched it other stuff optimization could be better but it is a beatiful game best play with a controller imo until you have to aim with a pistol uplay rating 10 /10 -1 for uplay 9 /10
['uplay'],on 12th december its free on uplay edit i made this review 4 years ago pls stop commenting on my profile lmao edit no the game is not free anymore and will not be guys look at the date ffs i lost faith in humanity
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'optimization', 'series']",before i start i just want to address one thing this is the best ac game i have played so far and i 'm a diehard fan of this series now let 's start by a simple pros /cons: pros +the game doesn 't take itself too seriously +you really feel like you are a pirate so careless and free to do what ever you want +almost no map limitations after the few first missions you are basically granted the opportunity to explore the world as much as you wish which hasn 't been possible in previous titles and exploring is as interesting as it can get massive amount of islands fisherman villages caves mayan ruins plantations etc and the game also rewards you alot for exploring +character design edward is an interesting main character and to be honest there has never been a side character so cool as edward thatch or well as most of us know him as blackbeard +map. it 's just big and full of places after 50 hours on the game i 'm still finding new islands to explore +the amount of side activities ranging from the usual assassination contracts to defeating legendary ships you will not run out of things to do +free roaming well this isn 't anything new to assassin 's creed series but the addition of freely sailing the seas and countering plenty of other ships to board and rob out of their cargo this game takes freedom of play to a whole new level cons -optimizing is quite bad (which really isn 't a surprise though as the game will be somewhat laggy even on better gaming rigs don 't expect too many fps with high graphichs if your pc isn 't top notch it 's not unplayable on computers that aren 't as good absolutely not but you should be prepared for certain fps drops and lowering your graphic quality etc -the story is quite short (no spoilers and sometimes feels like it 's a bit too much 'go there and kill him so we can be rich arrr story isn 't bad i really enjoyed it but i still hope it would 've been a bit more deep in some aspects summary this has got to be one of my favorite games of all times as it never fails to excite me are you a diehard fan of the series or just looking to be the 'deadliest scourge of these seas either one this game is for you enjoy
"['pirate theme', 'music']",i love this game what can be better than listening to sea shanties while being a pirate
"['uplay', 'optimization', 'customer support']",steam get your sh *t together when you purchase a uplay game from steam it installs an old version of uplay which can no longer connect to the server please go here https ://uplay.ubi.com/ and download the latest version than activate your game this update worked and ended an extremely frustrating installation i can play now
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'movement', 'entertainment value']",black flag is competing to be the best assassin 's creed title since assassin 's creed ii not only the story is well written to a point that not only the gamer relates to the main character a pirate named edward kenway it also creates an emotional tide with the adventure and exploration of sailing the high seas and hunting treasure and other bounties while discovering more about the assassins the templars and the secrets of both sailing before black flag was released there was a game no one heard of called pirates of the burning sea a f2p mmo that currently had the title for best sailing experience black flag took that away and better with a immerse and easy to understand camera and control mechanics sailing in black flag is an amazing time so much so that the game gives you the option to fast travel if needed and i played for over 50 hours completing the game without fast traveling once with the additions of random ai ships with different random cargo roaming the seas special challanges secrets and different weather and time conditions the sailing it self sells the game running the main aspect of running and jumping on rooftops and trees to explore ways to complete your objectives still a big thing and very well crafted the only con to it is that often you find yourself jumping in hay stacks or trees just by running aside some which is a very hard thing to balance but even tho very frustrating at the time it goes away as soon as you get done with it storyline the main storyline is very interesting to watch read and play with various famous characters as usual of an assassin 's creed game introduced very well in the story the ending feels solid and with enough questions for more story but not enough to upset anyone multiplayer the multiplayer feels more balanced than previous ac titles with more maps and a more fluid and skill based mechanic the only bad thing is that as always and sadly gamers would always for some reason find ways to exploit game mechanics for an easy win the game introduced gamelabs a feature that allows players to customize game modes everything from what skills can be used to how much a kill would be worth and what kind the issue currently with gamelabs is that you can only play your custom made game modes with your friends and only find a random 'approved' type on the public lobby with enough luck that would be fixed and a new feature would allow gamers to publicly host gamelab creations for any player to pick and play overall this is the level of detail the so called next gen titles should be all about great environments graphics level design interaction and details to very small things this might be the best ac title so far and might also be goty
"['storyline', 'combat', 'optimization', 'movement', 'graphics', 'entertainment value', 'stealth', 'customer support']",only halfway through but some impressions so far the bad -the overall structure is full of checklists of meaningless boring collectibles and repetetive side activies that sadly wear out their welcome too quickly at least there 's half a dozen types or so to vary it up as you play -main mission design is mostly ubisoft trash and full of 'trail/follow' or forced stealth garbage sadly a lot of good mechanical stuff is locked up behind their progression so you can 't just ignore them -checkpoints are surprisingly bad game over 'desyncs' when you cross arbitrary invisible walls are way too frequent and never stop being frustrating -contextual actions and movement is still really terrible and leads to numerous accidents where the insanely overloaded keybindings are a fight a dozen times more challenging than any actual enemies -melee combat is mostly trivial counter /punsh very easy and basically god mode considering how wonky stealth can be that 's probably an upside though the good -stealth doesn 't hold up to better games like dishonored but the open world approach gives enjoyable freedom to clearing complex enemy groups and settlements non -lethally without alert -ship combat looks fantastic and is way more fun and tactical than melee combat storms and boarding larger ships is spectacular stuff -the world looks fantastic and there is a ton of it just don 't get ocd about 'hovering up minimap symbols cause that 's a good way to oversaturate yourself while also missing it all at the same time -has a decent amount of hilarious open world jank and clunky ai behavior that 's way more entertaining than anything actually scripted -pet all cats (even the weird ones the ugly -i don 't think you can buy a pet parrot for your ship ever this is a bug that makes the game entirely unplayable and ubisoft should refund everyone 's money immediately this is the worst pirate game in the world ultimately the ocean may be a bit too shallow but it is very wide and enjoyably relaxing to cruise through (if you can ignore a few usual ubisoft virus symptoms
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'series', 'exploration']",great game most fun i have had pretending to pirate since sid meier took a shot at it in the 90s largely addictive great voice acting for the series and dialogue that isn 't painful to listen to on its own as well this game could have a real shot as the redefining moment for a series that has otherwise been largely stagnant unfortunately alot of those stagnations still exist here repeated follow /eavesdrop missions for instance all in all though this is easily what i would consider the best of the entire ac series since the first 2 games hope this is the start of a trend in making these more engaging and different /unique with each setting and iteration that follows check it out if you 're ready to hit the open seas with your own brig exploring the beautiful environments of the west indies

['assassin theme'],lets be honest best assassin 's creed
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']","sid meier 's pirates meets assassins creed the only thing this game is missing is a workshop full of mods to help enhance and keep things rolling a completist playthrough is good for about 100 -hours, but i don 't see myself playing through again without any mods to help enhance or change the experience and as a disabled gamer who plays to distract myself from pain i found the plethora of minigames to be an awesome plus one can easily find something in game to fulfill one 's gaming desires"

"['series', 'assassin theme']",in my opinion the best assassins creed in the series
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",this games amazing all the pirate glory you could hope for i 'm not a huge fan of the ac series and this has some of the flaw of the previous games however the carribean setting is fun and beautiful and all the unique features make this game a cut above the others +ship to ship combat +boarding combat +whaling +treasure hunting +diving for lost treasures +fleet management and trading +sea shanties all of these features combine for a fun and immersive experience they thought of everything
"['pirate theme', 'series', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'entertainment value']","arrr ye pirates assassin 's creed iv black flag feels slightly different than the other ac titles why 's that well first of all the main components are still the same you 're playing as edward kenway a pirate which ends up being involved in the assassins vs templar war the gameplay didn 't really changed as you 're still running and parcouring around in third -person. climbing up on lookouts to reveal the map collecting stuff like chests and animus fragments doing assassination missions and following the main quest about a mysterious observatorium so far everything as usual the one big thing which changed or was rather heavily extended is the ship you are sailing with already introduced in ac3 you 're also getting your own ship this time (of course what would a pirate be without a ship the 'jackdaw'. with said ship you 're spending a lot of time travelling through the caribbean sea hunting down whales and sharks exploring sunken ships and underwater caverns battling other ships and boarding them to get gold and ressources in order to upgrade the jackdaw (eg. more cannons reinforced hull different looking steering wheels or sails in my opinion the part where you are sailing around and enjoying the dynamic day and night cycle checking for profitable ships to hunt down or just enjoying the waves on the sea is the best part of the game the sea shanties (your crew will sing along on the open sea are also great for the atmosphere and pretty entertaining (i found myself singing along with them :d the story itself feels a bit bland and is starting off pretty boring in my opinion but it gets better throughout the missions and there are quite some interesting and likable characters which improves the story after the beginning the graphic is pretty good nothing groundbreaking but very atmospheric and it can create some beautiful moments especially with the day and night cycles the world itself is also quite big with enough places to visit and roam around to fill hours and hours of gametime if you don 't like collecting stuff or repetitive missions /ship battles then you might be bored after a while even though the ship battles feel quite dynamic at some point it 's still quite the same (especially if you upgraded your ship and you 're more powerful overall i found it to be a 'different' assassin 's creed title as i had the feeling that component wasn 't overly present i had much more fun sailing around and exploring than following the main mission but i think that 's also pretty subjective it 's still a very good game and i would recommend it to anyone liking the ac titles and /or good action -adventures, especially with a very good pirate -flair. now drink up me hearties and get back aboard treasures are waiting arrrr"

"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'music']",best pirate game maybe even go as far to say best assassin 's creed plus shanties i need not say more
['pirate theme'],i really love this game that being said when i play it it 's for the pirate portion not the assasin portion honestly i would buy other ubisoft games if they made them about pirates like this one

"['errors', 'uplay']",the game was fun until uplay deleted a 150 hour save game file uplay is a clunky unnecessary and poorly designed piece of software
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'exploration', 'movement']",i played this game over a month or two in early 2016 to have an escape to a pirate adventure it was one of my best gaming experiences ever as i was very invested in the plot and gameplay and i was up to have a rollicking good swashbuckle for an hour or two at a time you should get it now in 2020 for two reasons i think that the flow of the game now in the light of 'sea of thieves and looking back has advantages in the bigger more epic sea battles which you can also control more you also get slightly less freedom for more meaningful 'micro-worlds' on each island such as working through a plantation at night killing guards in silence until you reach the target not just a different island shape with the same content i 'd advise using the plot hand -in-hand with your sailing to drive your exploration of the islands sailing around collecting /unlocking sea shanties and then coming into port to do a mission old ac games always suffered from players fast travelling to missions once you got bored of the parkour this game solved that for me i often did missions to get the unlocks and cash needed to upgrade the ship and that then drove my way through the content lastly i didn 't mind the 'present day gameplay as i had no spoilers and was invested in the general ac games plot this isn 't too impactful as it can line up with your breaks but some other players don 't like it make sure you take breaks use the game to scratch that adventure itch rather than deep -dive. 56 hours and i had completed pretty much all the content averaged to an hour a day for two months i now look back with nothing but fond memories

"['storyline', 'character', 'movement', 'series', 'music']","easily one of the best games i 've played in a very long time it still follows a lot of the old school ubisoft assassin 's creed formulas in that you have to do a lot of following /tailing people (boo) and if you get seen even once the entire quest can fail not fun however you do feel awesome as edward kenway negatives 1 as a warning i played origins and odyssey first which colored my perception of some of the game 's mechanics i hated the way free running is done in this specific game quite often edward felt 'sticky' in that you couldn 't get him to just jump down or easily move to a different location it 's like 'edward, let go my boy let 's move along please stop sticking to the wall already 2 without any spoilers ...there are a couple of missions that nearly ruined my enjoyment one dealt with ship and stealthing at night another dealt with infiltrating an assassin island third were most of the tailing missions 3 slooooow moving and manuevering in the jackdaw which is an issue in some of the missions where waterspouts appear all over the place and you 're trying to attack a fort 4 no steam achievements 5 i usually love underwater sections in games these weren 't done as well as they could 've been 6 i 'm not a huge fan of the abstergo portions of the game i guess the story dealing with them was okay but it takes you out of the animus and breaks immersion positives 1 the story is really good you will probably love edward kenway he 's my favorite protagonist in the ac games so far 2 being a pirate is fun taking ships upgrading the jackdaw ...really enjoyable just sailing around on the ship is fun too 3 i love the sea shanties lots of people hated getting them but i had the full collection certain ones just stick out as some of the best music from any video game i 've played in a long time my crew would start singing 'leave her johnny and i 'd have to sit in place until they finished i had to hear it every single time they sang it eventually i 'd just sing along with the shanties ...and that 's not something most video games have ever inspired me to do while playing them 4 i genuinely liked the ship and trading minigame i know some people probably don 't, but it 's not required it 's just a little side thing that is pretty enjoyable 5 beautiful water graphics gorgeous scenery in other words if you haven 't played this game by now please give it a chance especially if you like ac games and love pirates it 's superb"

'although when i first started playing it i thought it was crazy sucks :d' this game has a lot of amazing locations different animals and a great atmosphere  a little about the game : i was pleased with the plot at least something from game to game does not change the story is great and it 's interesting to see how it ends i was pleased with the graphics and of course the sea with ships and boardings the whole gameplay somehow reminded me of far cry 3 (skinning, pumping   merits and flaws   addictive plot exits to the sea and battle with ships this is new for assassin 's creed pirate theme with rum and robberies the same type of tasks on land (follow and eavesdrop the most primitive stealth : you can pick at someone else 's pocket for at least half an hour and go unnoticed ground gameplay : no innovation is felt and when passing the previous parts everything will be on the machine one of the dumbest ais doesn 't color the game at all they don 't hear anything and they don 't always see well the combat system is still one -button.  a hackneyed topic about the templars and the assassins which has already been seen and heard a hundred times (more my nitpick than a flaw ).   i recommend the game for purchase just one of the best parts in my opinion assassin 's creed iv black flag should have been made as a separate game about pirates"
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'optimization']",pros +great protagonist +great story +great soundtrack +you can have your own ship with lots of customization +every character is memorable even just the random sailors on your ship who sing +very large and detailed playable areas +despite that it works on my potato computer cons -the ships you take can 't accompany you they can only be used in the optional overworld missions -i ran out of rum while playing the game
"['series', 'pirate theme']",this is possible the best game in this game franchise since ac2 and it 's a really a good pirate game too recommended to all assassin 's creed fans out there and those who want to give this franchise a try enjoy
"['storyline', 'music']",this game saved my life . i am 28 my ex -wife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both 4 years old when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide after learning of the severity of my self -inflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didn 't beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you in fact i may have only played this game a day or two with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my 'labor'. i relaxed for 5  minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay after coming to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as today i am close friend with my kids mother we don 't fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends i now have 3 kids my third child is wait for it also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly we have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldn 't be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that thank you

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'series', 'entertainment value']","i didn't know i needed to pillage pirate and sink ships in my life but black flag showed me i did and was missing out   black flag was my introduction to the assassin's creed series i watched some youtube videos to familiarize myself with the templars -assassin's story about what happened on 1 -3. i got the gist of it let me tell you that black flag is a great pirates game period you can take out the assassin's story and it still makes a great pirate game on it's own it can definitely be a game that can be played alone edward's story is moving the ending got me right in the feels i definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for a game where you can jump on a ship and sail around causing mayhem  as edward you sail out to the caribbean to make your riches so that you can support your wife so you leave her behind -a la the princess bride in order to get rich here's when you find yourself in the middle of a pirate -privateers-plunder-murders-pillaging world you play as a new analyst employed by abstergo that is syncing with edward kenway (pirate) in order to find the observatory (wanted by the templars  gameplay is excellent fights are kinda like batman arkham city but much better imo you have tons of activities in here my favorite was to take down forts you get to shoot cannons and mortars into forts on land in order to take them that was fantastic play you obviously also get to sink and fight ships sailing around but nothing comes close to the satisfaction of taking down a fort on shore my opinion took me about 4 -5 hours to finally beat one of the legendary ships in the game and i chose the one with 2 man o war ships thing made me rage quit once but was a fun challenge you get to dive under water and explore shipwrecks you get to hunt you get to learn how to be stealthy (i sucked at stealth and patience when having to do stealth mission in other games but in here you kinda have to learn there's really a lot of activities in this game  setting caribbean as someone born and raised in puerto rico i absolutely loved the feel of being in the islands this was done very well by the team the islands of cuba and city of kingston felt alive very beautiful scenery throughout since i'm puerto rican and my island was ravaged by the spanish conquistadors you bet your ass that i didn't hesitate to kill every single one of them mofos every time someone walked past me wearing that yellow and red uniform and speaking castellano they got shanked no questions asked i feel like i was the one that was using the animus in order to avenge my taino -african genes actually i'm suddenly starting to see visions and had a strange encounter with a girl in the grocery store that was missing a finger .....hmm...anyways, where was i oh yeah the islands and the feel of the era is amazing the spanish forts look just like el morro in san juan so i know that the development team did their homework it really takes you back to the times you get to pirate with blackbeard for christ's sake what more do you want from a game  long story short if you haven't played any assassin's creed yet this can be played as an introduction if you want it almost plays as a stand alone since it's not connected to desmond's story and edward is the grandfather of the character in iii and it's obviously a great pirate's story on it's own you can take out the whole assassin's story and edward's story can be played as a stand alone pirates game after all all he's after is plunder and booty but aren't we all"

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'movement', 'music']","ok for context i 'm old low -skill, and cheap i play on budget hardware which means (apart from indies i play mostly older games acquired on steep discount i think i got ac iv dirt cheap some years ago and finally got around to giving it a whirl my expectations were low i was very pleasantly surprised as mentioned i 'm old and one of my all -time favourites was 'pirates!' yes i played it so long ago that sid meier wasn 't yet famous enough for his name to make its way into the game 's title if the ubisoft team didn 't look back at the old classic for inspiration it sure feels like it like pirates all of the different aspects of the pirate life feel almost like different minigames sea battles attacking forts swordplay treasure hunting there is even the treasure fleet to find where the game really shines is in the naval combat it 's a blast it would be nice if you could sail different ships (i loved my trusty sloop in pirates but the different ship 's weapons you have at your disposal long -range mortars explosive barrels as mines a ram and regular broadside cannons allow for different styles of play the parkour -ey stuff is meh other reviewers seem keen on the story but it comes across as a bunch of mystical dan brown dreck to me maybe it means more in the bigger ac universe whatever it 's easily ignored so anyway if you 're reading this and on the fence about buying this title do it it is fun"

['entertainment value'],this game is very fun although they could remaster it for greater purposes
"['storyline', 'combat', 'pirate theme', 'exploration', 'character', 'graphics', 'series']",well it 's not as good as the trailers would tell you but it 's certainly not bad at all as usual the game looks great i guess there 's not much to add if you 're familiar with the rest of the series well the combat it 's hasn 't improved infact it changed a little bit for the worse it 's not as spectacular as it used to be and feels kind of clumsy to control the good part is you can have up to 4 preloaded pistols so at least thát helps either way you really should use all your tools in this game they 're totally op compared to the lack of fighting skills i guess it 's because you play some stinking peasant turned pirate rather than a trained assassin which is actually a nice change being no part of either templar or assassin but getting in too deep to avoid the crossfire the story does unfold quite nicely the new things in this game are obviously the ship battles gimmick from the last game well not too surprising since they went with a pirate theme most of the game is either at sea or in ports a lovely addition to the sea travel are the shanties a few drunks singing a song makes the trip more enjoyable so it pays off to search for a few the fun and yet frustrating part is boarding a ship to capture it somehow the controls suddenly go more wonky than usual when climbing the sails especially when there 's a few waves moving the ship and the decks always feel way too small with the amount of people getting in your way but most of the boardings look really cool and are fun to do for a while then there 's a whole new creature to hunt for the great white and his nautical buddies although whaling is basically just chucking spears at the beast untill it stops flopping it 's pretty cool and the sharks do put up quite a fight oh and another wonderful thing they added is underwater levels because we all know how much people love underwater levels they actually looks quite magical outside of the animus there 's a few computers to hack and obviously a less action -packed part of the story going on strangely enough you seem to be an abstergo employeé this time around although they really should 've included all the dlc 's if they wanted to ask such a high price for it oh well i bought it anyway when it was on a sale i blame the pirate theme arrr i guess i can 't complain all 'n all it 's an entertaining game pretty much worth what i paid for it this damn franchise tricks me into buying it anyway
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'movement', 'graphics', 'entertainment value', 'stealth']",tldr this is as far as my experiences go the best assassin 's creed game i have ever played or maybe it 's because i have a thing for pirates -themed games i don 't know story is there but certainly not the best part of the game it 's just there because every game needs one it 's the mechanics that works so well and contents that can make you spend 100 hours to complete all things in the game that 's not including the multiplayer (which i haven 't tried the old and tested formula of the ac series is still there but this time there are only 3 huge cities which still looks similar to other cities in the previous ac games and also looks similar to each other the fun part is on the sea it is a seamless experience that is so well implemented that it feels hassle -free and very fun at the same time for an example you can do an assassination side mission then right after you kill the target you can just jump into your ship drives away and wreak havoc shooting every passing ship that passes by naval combat is the highlight of this game for me there are a lot of different types of weapons your typical round shots chain shots mortars heavy shots fire barrels and swivel gun you can choose what to do with an enemy ship destroy it till it sink and get 50 of its cargo or damage it enough to be able to board a ship (kinda like in pokemon lol the boarding is fun too you 'll get different objectives which i think is randomized usually you 'll be told to kill a certain amount of enemies depending on how big that ship is then sometimes you are also given other minor objectives i 'm sure all people who have play any ac games know the part where you have to climb up to a vantage point and synchronize to unlock the locations of all secrets in a location it 's still there but now you also have to do that on the sea but through destroying a fort in an area the global map is divided into about 15 parts (never counted the exact amount and each part 's surface is blurred until you destroy the fort 's defenses and then get to the fortress and kill the commander (somewhat like fighting a ship just harder beside the main story and synchronizing at seas there are tons of activities you can do when you get bored you can find treasure maps and then look for the location solve mayan puzzles dive underwater to collect treasures sneaking to a warehouse and steal materials to sell hunting legendary ships collect music sheets which unlocks new chants your crew sings when you are exploring the sea hunt animals on land to unlock upgrades and craft outfits and also harpooning sharks and whales upgrading your ship is also essential to be able to progress through the game you will have no chance fighting a huge ship with only a handful of cannons and low hull armor this is part of the fun making your ship stronger and then pawning those cocky spanish / british fleet (try using your upgraded ship to destroy 3 frigates in a row it 's fun there is also a kind of mini games where you have a fleet of ships which you can send to do shipping missions that require a certain amount of time to complete like most social games out there if you have friends who also play this game they can help your ship complete the mission faster you can add captured ships to the fleet to make them able to complete bigger missions with bigger rewards there 's also a simple turn based combat system to make a trading route safer it 's pretty fun at first but in the end you just click everything and then forget about it (like social games now for the negatives i feel that the secrets and chests you can find on the global is too scattered (maybe it 's meant to be that way i 've been meaning to collect everything but there 's just too many things to collect (i'm sure it 's a good thing for some people the stealth aspect felt improved but still needs some tweaking it 's pretty difficult to move quickly from cover to cover when edward wants to climb and jump on everything (it's annoying not a significant problem though
"['pirate theme', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",best pirate game ever absolutely great graphics and wonderful ideas this game is extremely fun and i recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the previous games
"['storyline', 'combat', 'graphics', 'uplay', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'exploration', 'character', 'difficulty', 'customer support', 'cloud mechanics', 'full screen', 'entertainment value']","for the most part assassin 's creed iv black flag is a fantastic game for ease of interpretation i have decided to break my thoughts on the game down into a simple pros and cons list pros the open world sailing /plundering/exploring while aboard the jackdaw is by far the best aspect of the game the main storyline is decent (aside from the classic assassin 's creed 'outside the animus sections that everyone hates combat is fluid and easy to learn although it was very clearly designed for console all of the enviornments are beautiful and well designed voice acting was well done and there weren 't too many npcs with the same voices the upgrade system seems pretty reasonable outside of the fact that once you have enough money you can basically buy every upgrade without putting in any work to collect materials etc cons the game was very much designed for console which produces quite a few problems for pc users the ubisoft launcher is absolutely terrible and i have had several problems getting it to boot up properly also you will be unable to play the game if your ubisoft launcher has problems so there is no way to bypass this terrible system even with a fairly well built gaming pc higher level graphics options are etremely taxing and framerate drops are common gameplay becomes repetitive after a certain point and the quests outside of the main storyline aren 't anything to write home about after you have maxed out all of the upgrades for the jackdaw /edward, nothing really presents a challenge very little replay ability the cutscenes for sucessfully boarding a ship are all identical except for the fact that they are re -skinned depending on if the ship is spanish english or pirate hunters this is quite annoying if you pillage more that 10 ships (you definitely will i already mentioned this above but the 'real life sections of the game where you exit the animus are terrible every time one came up i found myself saying 'please end this stupidity so i can go back to the story that i care about perhaps some people feel differently about these scenes but most seem to agree that the game would have been better if they had been left out all together multiplayer is clunky and feels like an afterthought there is no real opportunity to play with friends in the way that would actually be fun (a fleet of customized ships sailing around engaging in massive battles and accomplishing various goals conclusion i really did (and still do enjoy this game there are very few high quality pirate themed games on the market and black flag definitely fills that need the game is by no means a masterpiece of storytelling nor is it a real divergence from the classic assassin 's creed model however it is a ton of fun to play (especially if you love pirates and the add -ons for the delux edition are worth playing as well i would give this game a rating of 7 /10 simply because of the clunky conversion from console to pc and the constant issues with the ubisoft launcher if black flag was as good on pc as it is on console i would give it a 9 /10."
"['series', 'assassin theme']",played it back in the days on ps3 and now again on pc the last good assassin 's creed game if you ask me
"['storyline', 'combat', 'series', 'optimization', 'uplay']",while not a traditional assassin 's creed game to most veterans of the franchise black flag offers a lot to both long -term fans and new comers both the sea combat and the land combat are enjoyable pros large world interesting land /sea combat lots of collectibles that feel meaningful decent amount of customization nice story cons ubisoft game so your game is held to ransom behind a second account and launcher (uplay) ubisoft game so the tasks in the different areas start to get very repetative
['entertainment value'],great for this quarantine mate
['no topic'],it 's a great pirate game however there are some important things to know before buying ubisoft has abandoned this game they don 't support it (or you any longer they 've removed the kenway 's fleet mobile app they 've removed cloud saves (so you have to manage your own saved game files this means if your computer breaks you lose your entire progress if you have 2 computers tough luck it won 't sync also the game requires you to use a different piece of software to run manage the game (it's called uplay this means that all of your achievements are hidden within some stupid additional app they won 't count towards or show on your steam profile
"['storyline', 'errors', 'uplay']",before i bought the game i saw those negative comments and i didn 't understand why because this game is good when i bought the game i still didn 't understand why those negative comments because this game is great after some days of playing the game (i played only 5 -7 hours well i realized why i 'm not going to talk about how much the game bad and he has bugs no the game is great and has no bugs i 'm going to talk about ubisoft ubisoft the worst company i have ever seen after 1 month i wanted to play this game but when i connected to ubisoft it showed me that i don 't have this game i tried to activate the key but it just said that i can 't because this key already used (i used it then i tried to contact ubisoft many times (their website facebook and more but as you can understand they didn 't even respond i tried to contact steam with a very long message that tells everything that happened but i don 't think they even tried to read the message they just sent me an email that says that i can 't get a refund because i played the game more than 2 hours shame the game is good ubisoft sucks thank you for reading this
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'graphics']",+pirates +story +graphics +idea -short story overall 9 /10; best ac i 've played yet
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",assassin 's creed black flag led me to learn about the geography of the caribbean the history of famous pirates and the story of 18th century colonial europe i also enjoyed the game a great deal
"['graphics', 'storyline', 'stealth', 'combat', 'series', 'exploration', 'difficulty']",graphics are fantastic for the time story isnt some classical ubisoft copy and paste its actaully entertaining and well written stealth and basic combat is very easy but fun ship combat is well done and really fun fighting via ships can be easy or extremely difficult (especially the legendary ships loads of content and side stuff played through it twice and loved it more the second favourite ac game to date 10 /10 in my books
"['no topic', 'character', 'movement', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'optimization']",i 'm gonna start off with the big negative to this game because everything else is a as far as i 'm concerned the single largest con to this game on pc in my opinion is the controls they 're wonky clunky half the time your character does things you don 't want him to do and half the time you want to do something and it won 't. it 's just kind of a mess i don 't know how many times i died or failed an objective solely based on the crappy controls i 'm not talking about key mappings but just how bad it feels now that 's out of the way everything else is great the character building the progression the story the scenery graphics (for a 2013 released game the pirate ship battles at sea and not to mention there is a ton of content and things to do in the game overall i highly recommend it i did get it on a steam sale for $13 so that definitely factors into my decision for the game 's value
['no topic'],years later and neither steam nor ubisoft care to rectify the blatant disregard of not selling the product some people paid for with the season pass i 'm sorry but when you openly state something as being included in the season pass and then refuse to add it to the season pass dlc you are commiting a crime of false advertisement
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",sadly as with all games in the assassinating creed franchise this game was not about murdering the members of the post -grunge rock -band creed and although i am still disappointed with these circumstances this game has good pirate stuff despite the disclaimer during game startup warning me that the game 'was designed developed and produced by a multicultural team of various religious faiths and beliefs it 's pretty obvious from the cobbled together abstract sci -fi bullshit it was made by french canadians
['no topic'],jenny do you think we 'll have a chance of seeing pirates edward no i don 't think so ''man doesn 't cry
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",more like pirate 's creed really for the first half of the game the protagonist is not even an official assassin he just kills a man who happens to be an assassin then took his uniform and wear it most probably the best pirate game ever
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'combat', 'exploration', 'storyline', 'music']",easily the best assassin 's creed game bar none lots of pillaging raiding naval battles fort battles mayan puzzles and even a bit of intrigue and sea shanties lots of sea shanties
"['storyline', 'character']",the last 2 hours made this one heck of a ride edward is no ezio but the kenway family line is very spicy
['series'],best assassin 's creed to date
"['series', 'graphics', 'optimization', 'frame rate']",hands down my favorite game in the ac series even if ac2 is arguably better as a whole being a pirate is just far more fun than being an assassin who knew game looks great plays well and fighting ships and upgrading your ship to fight bigger ships never gets old one caveat the game has some crap performance even after upgrading to a gtx 980 ti i was still only getting ~40 fps until i found a crazy fix that works first let nvidia control panel handle the vsync the game 's vsync is crap second and it 's really weird after loading into the game lock your computer then re -open the game window this takes my perf from ~40 to ~60 every time don 't know why doesn 't make sense it 's some kinda weird bug but by god it works
"['storyline', 'character', 'graphics']",im not usually an assasins creed fan but this game is awesome love the new setting and character a must buy if you like the idea of an open world assassin pirate game oh and the graphics omg beautiful :3

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'stealth', 'combat', 'movement', 'entertainment value', 'series', 'optimization', 'frame rate']",(--assassin’s creed iv black flag the best pirate game i 've ever played in my life if your like me you 'll love the open world more than the missions this is my first assassin 's creed since the first of the series heres a little review of my opinion on this game  pros  -up to 60 hours of both fun and challenging missions -the storyline is a blast -the open world is huge -the open world gameplay is almost better than the missions -the ocean detail is amazing the physics on the waves and storms are amazing as well -the ships are the best in any kind of pirate game i 've played -the ships overall physics as well as the ocean -awesome ship managment -amazing side missions -intense naval battles -graphics are impressive -beautiful islands -the stealth gameplay is very nice -ship customizations -ship upgrades -various weapons pistols and a lot more equipment -various detailed appearal -combat is awesome -own different settlements for yourself and other territories -hundreds of hours of new discoveries -only 19gb download (not including dlc 's)  cons  -you can only own one ship for yourself (which it 's not that bad of a ship i just wish you can have a man o war -a few glitches rare (some i find comical -multiplayer is okay i wish they would have added more ocean battles -low framerate  ratings  8 /10 worth every penny this game deserves overwhelimingly positive theres not very many games like this i hope this helps you decide if this game is for you
"['storyline', 'uplay', 'exploration', 'character', 'entertainment value', 'graphics']","assassin's creed black flag  to give you a rough idea of how much i enjoyed this game 63 hours in i lost my save to uplay sync issues (forgot to disable cloud sync after reinstalling uplay and didn 't actually mind having to start over from scratch i can safely say that this game has single -handedly restored my faith in the ac series it really taps into your inner adventurer and every new element seems cleverly designed to make you want to keep going craving for more pros:  refreshing story that distances itself from the usual assassin vs templar plot matt ryan does a brilliant job as edward kenway —and so does the rest of the cast kenway is a believable flawed protagonist seafaring, upgrading the ship and exploring is fun and addictive hunting and crafting is straightforward and cleverly integrated to gameplay fast-travel to viewpoints makes things a lot less cumbersome and exploring that much more attractive interesting, less intrusive approach to present day storyline beautiful caribbean setting and very good -looking graphics in general rating memories feels productive (if true and is well implemented in context  neutral:  split between overly familiar side quests and new and exciting ones kenway's fleet doesn 't reset if you start a new game some unnecessary capitalisation in the subtitles in a misplaced attempt to mirror old english decent soundtrack  cons:  kenway's fleet isn 't as fun a trading system as it could have been (especially ship battles cross-shaped weapon selection is less accessible than the wheel in my opinion database is less handy to follow the story /catch up on lore than previous iterations (no 'recent entries etc "
"['entertainment value', 'combat', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'music']","literally the best game i 've ever played at least certainly my favorite game i have never felt so immersed in and compelled by a game in my life the music the scenery the world the ships all these combined perfectly to pull me deep into the world of the game ship combat 10 /10 you have not felt immersion until you have stood at the wheel of a pirate ship dodging and blasting your way through a five -way naval battle in an intense gale the ship controls are perfect and allow you a huge amount of control over the jackdaw as soon as i got my ship i spent days of real time just sailing around fighting plundering and upgrading i can 't get enough of it i have played over 300 hours of this game and the naval combat has never once felt boring or stale every fight is an adventure (provided you fight the ships in your 'weight' class i have beaten all the legendary ships i have upgraded all aspects of my ship to 100 (including the legendary upgrades i even went on a treasure chest hunt so i could get that special ship 's wheel customization i wanted all in all this is the best sailing /naval combat game in existence (that i 've played at least non -ship combat 8 /10 you are rambo edward can literally take on the entire crew of a british man -o'-war singlehandedly and win the combat is fun and fast but it 's pretty much just a button -masher. if you 're looking for an innovative hand -to-hand combat engine you won 't find it here (i'd recommend shadow of mordor also the game occasionally glitches meaning you throw someone in the wrong direction stab the air etc (this is a rare issue though still the combat and especially the boarding sequences (the game transitions seamlessly from naval combat to ship boarding stereotypical pirate rope swinging included is exciting and fast -paced, and makes you feel like you 're in a less -silly pirates of the caribbean film story (7/10) for a non choice -driven story this game really delivers i felt very invested in edward 's character and i felt that he underwent significant and realistic character development many people say they dislike the story because edward is motivated by greed but in my opinion those people have missed the point this story is about a man achieving his dream of wealth only to realize (spoiler) too late that love and family are the greatest treasures of them all i almost cried at the ending (spoiler ends here frankly i would have given the story a higher rating if not for the assassin and abstergo portions which i found to be boring uncompelling and repetitive world 10 /10 i 've been to the caribbean and i have to say that this game 's portrayal of the sea and islands is spot -on. the world is totally open and the seas positively teem with trade and warships from different colonial powers (which occasionally fight each other for you to plunder also there are so many beautiful islands to explore that you can spend days of real -time getting through them all although the map is of course limited it very rarely feels that way you feel like the sea is yours to roam soundtrack 9 /10 as a music major i hear a lot of great music by great composers this game 's music is right up there with those in some places the music changes a bit too fast for my taste in some places (such as when you 're going from naval to shipboard combat but that 's just a matter of personal preference it 's like pirates of the caribbean but different my only true complaint is that sometimes some of my crew sing a tad off -key in the sea -shanties. i like the shanties they are catchy and add to the experience but to be honest off -key singing drives me insane luckily this isn 't the case with all the shanties overall 42 /50 (84%) if you like pirates buy this game i would have gladly paid double the price if i had known how good this game was my rating is not 100 because i feel there are some aspects of the game that could be improved that being said i repeat that this is the most fun i have ever had playing a video game"
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'combat', 'series']",some say that this game has to be one of the worst acs in history but the best pirate game ever i highly disagree ac4 black flag manages to fit the conflict between templars and assassins during the golden age of piracy and the protagonist has an amazing character arc as for the gameplay iself outstanding open world graphics in 2020 still look impressive after all this years combat is exactly like ac3 which it was one of the best combat systems
['no topic'],i shrekommend this game
"['graphics', 'storyline']",best one so far in the series odyssey 's graphics and detail level is stunning but black flag has the best story and gameplay imo

"['storyline', 'combat', 'frame rate', 'series', 'entertainment value']",assassins creed 4 black flag is an awesome game it has great combat both naval and when dueling i found the story started off strong but got progressively worse however i enjoyed the game far past the end of the main story [which took me 25 hours your results may vary and i ended up getting 75 hours out of it the multiplayer is miserable but the end game content and side quests are great for some reason i was capped at 30fps damn youn ubisoft while i hated teh ending off this game it had a ton of solid content and the main questline had some outstanding moments gameplay wise the side missions and exploration are even better offering stories of their own and allowing you to make your own story assassins creed 4 not revolutionary but awesome a solid 8 .5/10
['pirate theme'],best pirate game out there by far won 't find one any better than black flag
"['storyline', 'character', 'combat', 'graphics', 'music', 'series']",a refreshing take on the assassin 's creed series with a memorable protagonist during the pirate era good gameplay memorable characters beautiful environments a soundtrack suiting to my ears and last but not least great sailing mechanics and naval combat this is the ubisoft i admire (just like in the early 2000 's) unlike nowadays

['pirate theme'],one of the few really good pirate games out there

"['series', 'storyline', 'character', 'pirate theme', 'movement']",pros -unique setting and theme for ac series -good story not as boring as older titles of ac -no modern day chapter f *ck you desmond -pirates -matt ryan cons -still using older ac animation and parkour feels little bit clunky -trailing missions best pirate game ever till today and just forget atlas and sea of thieves exist

"['errors', 'full screen']",recent update forces a white bar on top of your screen no matter what you do ill recommend when fixed big note do not try and press alt enter for full screen like other games it will crash on start up every time got support and was told 'use magnifier or change my screen resolution don 't wait on a update to fix it
"['music', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'assassin theme']","one of the best soundtracks to ever exist in a game ,listening to the sea shanties while cruising a ship towards your destination truly made me feel as if i was on a pirate ship the story also made me very emotional and the experience of naval combat was such an amazing addition to the assassins creed franchise the soundtrack alone was worth to buy the game"
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'optimization', 'graphics', 'series', 'storyline']",a pirate who plays the role of an assassin and finds himself steering a ship full of pirates yes this is black flag finally an assassin 's creed optimized for the pc the effect of the water is something exceptional backdrops so real that from the desire to dive you will take the pc monitor to test if you like the assassin 's creed saga and you like the stories of pirates buy it absolutely it does not even present too repetitive missions during the total synchronization of the game
['series'],best assassin 's creed game c
['series'],one of the best in the franchise
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'graphics', 'music', 'exploration', 'character', 'combat', 'animals', 'entertainment value', 'customer support', 'optimization']",this was one of my top goty of 2013 due to the fact that it was the best out of the entire series up to date and yes enemy drowns in this one wooo anyways to top it off some of the most memorable characters and music exist in this game too bad they make very short cameo as a player you 'll be working in abstergo and entering the animus to relive the life of edward kenway and you 'll be sailing a large area of the caribbean sea during the age of piracy more than 40 of the game takes place in the sea which you 'll be sailing and pirating this is quite possibly the best pirate game up to date without the stereotypical aspects of piracy just traveling your boat around in the ocean is quite fun and the weather system is great +graphic is great on this especially if you have the card to go farther and the monitor don 't hate +music is fantastic so are the sound effects +water effects is wow and the weather with the storm and winds is fantastic +the pirates sing shanty on your queue and it 'll get stuck in your head +voice acting is superb in this +sailing for hours in the sea and just pirating people sailing storms taking over forts attacking epic pirate ships whaling and hunting animals cough farcry 3 glad they brought that in undersea exploration and more the costumes can either be ugly or great to some this is all depending on your preference theres tons of collectables sometimes can be quite a nuiscance to collect +-some of the costumes are meh same ass multiplayer i played it in all creeds all they did really was upgrade a new mode and added some new moves it gets dry really fast after playing maybe a couple of days then you 'll eventually forget it even exists wolfpack is interesting but gets dry +-story was decent ending was super expected if you follow the series -some of the really awsome characters in this game make really short cameos kid the pirate and blackbeard etc they are fantastic and memorable but you didn 't get much time with them to feel the connection this game was bugged when it came out i couldn 't 100 it and drove me nuts -not enough end game content you can only fight 4 overall a much better game than all previous games will make it hard to replay the old ones if you touch this one even going back to hd remakes will make you go bleh

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'animals']",last i played this was 5 years ago but it is still in my memories as the most pirate life experience you can have (fair to mention its the only pirate theme game i have played your journey from a raider that craves for pleasures and wealth to a member of a creed with ideals and ambition begins it 's a beautiful game to sink hours to activities i remember sailing from port to port in the caribbean with my sailors singing sea shanties while whales sharks pop out the water exploring underwater ship wrecks visiting random rocks that turned to islands sinking legendary ships ...robbing plantations and depots harpooning hunting animals to make gear exploring maya whereabouts visiting havana cuba endless ubisoft 's collectibles defeating forts treasure hunting destroying ships with fully upgraded jackdaw 's ram hanging enemies with rope darts etc 'oh no i 've said too much i set it up
"['storyline', 'character', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",this game was the reason why i decided to buy the rest of the ac games i can 't help but compare every other ac game to this one because of how well written and designed this is a must play for a fan seeking adventure and wanting to actually grow alongside your character a true masterpiece of storytelling
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",all the pirate stuff is magnificent the story comes to a screeching halt whenever they decide to do the classic assassins creed crap that doesnt mesh with whats actually going on but overall pirates are fun
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'assassin theme']",a masterpiece probably the game of the saga i liked more when talking about the gameplay sailing the sea looking for new islands and ships to loot is incredibily fun and i believe the upgrade system of the ship and the character itself is really balanced and well made some people didn 't like this game because it 's a little different from the classic assassin 's creed plot but it 's likeable nontheless and probably the best pirate game out there i played it back then on an xbox but was now on sale for like 6 so i decided to buy it and play it again
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'movement', 'graphics', 'assassin theme', 'character', 'stealth', 'music']","in the words of mark twain now and again we had the hope that if we lived and were good god would permit us to be pirates regardless of what you might think of old samuel clemens a man thoroughly set and yet contrasting to his time this notion is i think one that many can relate to are you one that yearns for the freedom of living according to your own actions whims and choices alone then maybe this game is for you black flag is a great pirate game it is arguably the best pirate game i have ever played the gameplay graphics and music are all very good and the writing a topic i won 't dwell on for fear of spoiling it for you is truly spectacular the movement and parkour are much more polished in this title as compared to other assassin 's creed games aswell making it feel more streamlined and much more intuitive (no more accidentally jumping to your death there are some who argue that this game is less an assassin 's creed game and more a pirate game on surface i could agree as the assassin 's are less of a role in the story which focuses more on a slightly morally decrepit privateer turned pirate named edward kenway (voiced by the wonderful matt ryan whom you may know from the likes of recent media depictions of john constantine personally i would say that pirates are the perfect analogy of the assassins both being to some extent hopeful anarchists that trust humankind is ultimately good enough to take care of itself not needing some god or ruler to threaten them with punishment for wrong deeds and this is more what the game touches on a more thorough examining of 'everything is permitted nothing is forbidden in a way pirates like the assassin 's act according to a certain creed a life lived by the collective madness of us all and not the decisions of a single madman perhaps grim maybe even dark and unforgiving but invariably gloriously free and by that fact romantic tl :dr good f *cking game stellar writing awesome as f *ck pirates solid main character explosions and stealth 10 /10, should get if you like any of the above definitely get if on sale"
"['storyline', 'exploration']",a perfect assasin 's creed game the locations the characters and the story are all memorable and it even has a good story outside of the animus that still fits and is interesting to explore unlike other games where i would just want to go back into the animus i 'm pleased when i 'm forced out of the animus so that i get to experience the enjoyable story that occurs outside of it

"['storyline', 'entertainment value']",an absolute masterpiece even in 2019 it remains a must have the gameplay and story are both amazing
"['uplay', 'assassin theme']",warning if you buy this or any other assassins creed game make sure your email is the same for steam and u -play and ubisoft or you wont be getting access to the game despite having paid for it ubisoft has gone so far up their own a with this anti -piracy bs that it ruins any kind of experience you could potentially have with the game and in my case makes it un -playable. i wont recommend any ubisoft title for this reason and will not be buying any of their products in the future
"['storyline', 'series', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",assassin 's creed iv black flag is an action -adventure stealth game with open world environment from ubisoft it is the next installment in assassin 's creed series and a prequel to assassin 's creed iii in terms of storyline desmond miles is dead but his legacy continues an unknown abstergo entertainment employee is doing research on desmond ancestors in the familiar machine called animus based on desmond samples where he dives into the history of the one of many fearless and notorious pirates edward kenway assassin 's creed iv black flag like assassin 's creed iii get some gameplay change and improvements again most improvements are very good and makes the game more fun and entertaining the story takes place before the event of assassin 's creed iii you play as edward kenway grandfather of connor kenway and a father to haytham kenway in some location in this game like in the city of havana we can go back to the building climbing style of gameplay while in most location where it 's not a city the tree climbing still present a lot but the best thing this assassin 's creed has to offer is sea battles piracy while not on mission or on the way to mission location you can engage and loot spanish or her majesty ships fleets or convoy and loot them for money and resources ship -to-ship battles has been improved a lot in this game that most of the time you will forget the mission and do some piracy instead sometimes i wonder how a small brig can take down 2 big spanish galleon without a scratch and live to tell the tale but those moment are awesome but that just only one of many new features in this game that you can try there are other things you can do like hunting sharks wales or any of those extinct fish explore undersea shipwreck and gets eaten by sharks attack and conquer spanish and /or british coastal forts or maybe you just want to play checkers here sadly the assassin 's brotherhood feature has been taken out in this game and replaced with kenway 's fleet new mini -game. but many of these features are great and there is still more to see graphics of assassin 's creed iv black flag for me i don 't know i don 't see much difference with assassin 's creed iii except the effect on the sea sea can be very unpredictable here sometimes the waves are calm sometimes you have to face a small tsunami or hurricane which will damage you beloved ship performance of assassin 's creed iv black flag is good i haven 't encounter any bugs or glitch and the game runs smoothly in multiplayer mictotransactions are back i don 't know why ubisoft do that but it 's not like you have to buy them so no harm done here assassin 's creed iv black flag in my opinion is the second best assassin 's creed after assassin 's creed ii ever i recommend this rating 9 /10
"['series', 'storyline', 'combat', 'graphics']",i thought ac iii was good this bad boy blows it straight out of the water best ac game yet the game is huge with a tonne of things to do has a great story solid gameplay naval combat is great and the graphics are brilliant especially on the water must own
['series'],the best ac game since ac2 possibly even better
"['assassin theme', 'series']",in my opinion is the beast assassins creed ever made
"['combat', 'assassin theme', 'difficulty', 'pirate theme', 'exploration', 'character', 'optimization', 'series', 'graphics', 'movement', 'customer support', 'animals']",great fuking game even in 2020 a great game fighting 10 /10 assassin 10 /10 sometime is annoying to climb cause you dont controll it to 100 pirate 10 /10 doesn 't have a lvl system like in the new ones upgrading your ship upgrading your base at one point you can 't get every item (1 pistol 1 sword 2 ship designs one difficulti (normal) looting 8 /10 you need to collect everything to get 100 sometimes it can be annoying villages / islands 10 /10 its awesome to play it has some ship bugs but those bugs aren 't game destroying its more like fun to see them (ships spawns 200 m over sea or giant hole in the water where your ship spawns
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'character', 'stealth', 'movement', 'graphics', 'combat', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']","the best entry in the series after assassin 's creed 2 black flag proves a game can overcome several flaws as long as it manages to be fun a high -budget pirate sandbox action /adventure where you can sail around the sea from kingston to nassau board enemy ships during naval battles roam crocodile -infested swamps run parkour -style on the roofs of havana dig for buried treasures in small atolls i mean how can one not love a premise like that it 's an instant winner characters are vivid voice acting solid dialogues written with surprising flair history provided here is the usual 'based on real events baloney pirates are romanticized into brave rebels whatever don 't play assassin 's creed expecting reliable history lessons sadly the modern -day abstergo plot the series tiresome framing device refuses to go away and die what would you rather do in a game about pirates take control of your ship in the middle of a storm or speak to your boss in a corporate office every time the game shifts to a modern -day sequence (thankfully, not often it 's like getting commercials in the middle of a blockbuster black flag has a few dubious design choices insta -failure stealth missions are grating they would be less annoying if the stealth system was exceptionally well thought -out, but this isn 't the case enemy ai has its issues for example sentinels are remarkably unaffected by the disappearance of their comrades combat is once again dominated by the stupidly overpowered counter attack and speaking of overpowered special mention goes to berserk darts which allow to complete many missions with absurd ease overall you 'd think stealth and combat would be more polished in a series about assassins still the game is better than the sum of its parts and highly enjoyable in particular its mix of naval and terrestrial exploration (journey to far away islands visit jungles with jaguars and mayan ruins is fantastic my rating 8 / 10 a definite buy"

revelations where it ended off desmond woke up from his coma and was off to another new adventure in ac3 you overall got also introduced to a new assassin connor which most people call him uninteresting or lacking in terms of what ezio had in store for you but you shouldn 't really put much blame on ac3 because of the assassin design and what his atitude was in general connor in my honest opinion was a brutal as hell assassin a loving and caring person when it came to his natural enviormeant the village and the homestead but a literall devil on the battlefield characther design and atitude in general were pretty good and didn 't lack in anything if you understood the point of his characther overall ac3 overall was a pretty great game can 't be top tier like ac2 or bf but it was a pretty great game in general now for bf bf is either great terific amazing glorious or god tier it 's pretty much an undescribable game for me really i enjoyed the hell out of it as a fan of the franchise for a long time the overall core gameplay of it was smooth and fast paced and it was just an adrenaline rush in its own ways the game offered us a better and more extende naval combat system which we have been asking for from ac3 and its probably the most fun you could also have in the game the game in general is mainly covered 60 sea and 40 land making the naval combat one of the more important aspects of the game the naval combat in bf is far superiour than what other pirate /ship battle games have and its quite alot of fun to just destroy the hell out of some giant fleets now overall the story and characther of the game in bf the story picks off some time latter from ac3 overall your characther is unknown as he is some kind of employe working for abstergo as a double agent of some sorts since you technicaly share intel with the assassins troughout the game in the modern day missions of the game shaun and rebeca overall the modern day segments are covered in a first person perspective and are just a bit odd fun but odd the fun thing you could really have in the modern day segments is just randomly collecting some qr codes and hacking pc 's, yes hacking is a thing in this game the hacking is pretty fun altough it repeats the same short minigame of either switching frequencies turning a line from point a to point b in order to unlock the file or just a simple cracking the firewall type of game pretty short but they are also pretty fun in general the story of bf takes before the actions of ac3 so that means your way behind playing as the grandfather of connor kenway captain edward james kenway or as people called him that started off as a privateer at the begining of the game overtaken for the lust of having a better life greed is his main priority he takes as he pleases and doesn 't give a rotten damn about anything but hey thats the usual which you expect from a pirate but troughout the game thinking that he may be some bad characther he overall isn 't, he did get a bad reputation with both secret organizations but overtime learnt the morals of which had taken him quite some time to understand over that course he sought to fight along side the creed and follow its morals he also was technicaly the founder and grand master of the english assassin 's brotherhood he grew to be quite a likeable characther in my opinion atleast the core gameplay of it is as same as it was in ac3 with a few difrent changes to fit the playstyle of a pirate duel wielding cutlasses and owning 4 flintlock pistols is the deal with ac4 the naval combat also has been improved from ac3 and also making it the main thing in the game the game adds another important characther to it the jackdaw which is your ship that you sail trough the caribeans plundering and taking as you want it 's important that you take of your ship as it becomes quite the game changer if you upgrade it to max and all overall the game is good it 'll take you aroudn 20 -23h to complete that is if you spend next to no time on the naval contratcs templar hunts assassin contracts and such oh yeah and upgrading your ship which will take you quite a while to find the parts as there also a new mechanic added to game called treasure hunting you can find treasure maps from dead or unconcious corpses stranded on the shores of the locations you discover each treasure map will containt either gold or an upgraded plan for the jackdaw and some aditional gold sure gota love that pirate feel afterwards anyways got a bit offtrack there the game at its base is great and all has a very small amount of glitches exclude the sinken rising ship thing which ocasionaly happens with the jackdaw and so fort the gameplay is great and is just amazing in some sense as you feel like a genuine pirate with the tools at your disposal a much recommended game and also a favourite in my category as it just captures everything you could need in an ac game"

"['storyline', 'combat', 'series', 'graphics', 'movement', 'uplay']",tl ;dr pirate 's creed refreshing and fun assassin ’s creed stagnant and boring by the third ezio game i was suffering asscreed fatigue and i quickly gave up on it i ’d played the two previous games in fairly quick succession but the similarities in revelations were glaringly obvious by that point and i just couldn ’t bring myself to continue even the lure of the wonderful architecture and the likeable protagonist couldn ’t draw me back to yet another game with repetitive side missions numerous pointless collectables and stylish but shallow combat also tailing missions fuck tailing missions asscreed iii never really appealed to me because of the historical setting and i only played a little of it that game had a dull protagonist and a dull setting with the architecture of 18th century america not matching up to what europe had to offer at the time this diluted the parkour the one gameplay mechanic that might have kept me playing for longer this is all a big preamble to me saying that assassin ’s creed iv bought some of the fun back to the franchise for me by making pirate ships a new core mechanic the sailing and naval combat are a big part of the game and it ’s good arcadey fun it also helps that the protagonist is fairly likeable in a roguish kind of way (ala ezio anything outside of the ‘being a pirate stuff is the same old ass creed (worse in some cases and it gets boring quickly but the piracy setting and gameplay additions are enough for a recommendation on a final note fuck u uplay
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'assassin theme', 'graphics']","the ultimate pirate sandbox  i would recomend this one even to a non -ac fan it is a great pirate game this one tells a story about a pirate who only cares for himself he steals murders and does many other bad things then he meets a crossdressing woman who tells him that is not a way to live she want 's him to sacrifice his life for a 'a greater good he refuses at first but when all the people he cares for die he realizes that being selfish really isn 't the way so he stops being a priate and becomes an ninja terrorist so that now he can steal and murder with an excuse appart from the usual conspiracy cr *p, black flag is actually a good enough character driven game of course it has some weak moments but those are mostly caused by the illogical creeds and fanaticism of the conspiring factions and the antiestablishment nonsense (and really bad written death of a really good characters no ubisoft pirates did not fly black flag as a sign of freedom there is however very little of it for the most of the game you trully are a pirate you meet templars and assassins but you don 't care for them you just rob them the gameplay did not really change much from ac3 appart from the fact that sailing levels are now a major part of the game a bit polished improved with some new features and really fun the parcour is the more stable and responsive and the world is filled with actually interesting things to do not just tons of collectibles it is also the first ac since brotherhood with actuall colour and pretty world the story is nicely paced not forcing any urgency on the player so you can experience everything on the pace that most fits you bonus why is it every time someone in the game says 'jesus' they spell it 'jaysus' in subtitles for a 'multicultural team of various faiths and beliefs there should be no problem to use the name with clear conscience"

"['series', 'exploration', 'combat', 'character', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",assassins creed black flag has got to be one of the best in the series and yet once again i know i only have 43 .6 hours on the game but (again) thats all it took me to 100 this game on pc as a massive fan of the assassins creed series this game was one of the first to actually have a 'fully explorable map with proper sailing a naval combat included as you take control of your pirate ship you can sail all over the caribbean while fighting different types of ships the combat is just a little off but it has a great combat system that from the moment i used it i didnt want to stop fighting and killing every guard i saw you can solve puzzles that are kinda similar tothe ones from 'tomb raider to get your hands on some sweet pirate loot or when you are ready and upgraded the 'jackdaw' you can take on some of the hardest battles in the game 4 legendary ships await you and trust me they will punish you the characters and story of this assassins creed are amazing breathtaking and unforgettable due to the fact it has blackbeard in it the pirate that supposedly 'got his head chopped off and he swam around his ship several times before he died haha you can also explore underwater wrecks for treasure and upgrades for your boat 'the jackdaw now dont get me wrong deep water comes with its horrors it also has a sweet dlc called freedom cry that you play as adewale a slave that joined kenway and became his right hand man its set 15 years after the events of black flag so i wont go into to much about this but it is a great dlc addition to an already big assassins creed game also before i give my rating if you are feeling a little lazy and cant be bothered looking for everything the game does offer time saver packs that speed up your ships upgrades kenways upgrades and it also marks treasure locations for you all in all assassins creed black flag is an amazing game and one you wont want to miss if you are a fan of the series for the many reasons i have stated above i rate it a 9 /10 due to the occasional boat wanting to ram into me in the water or at my pirate hideout and send my boat to heaven
"['optimization', 'graphics', 'combat', 'series', 'exploration', 'character', 'uplay', 'entertainment value', 'stealth', 'movement']",the short of it is performance wise i 've heard there are some glitches but never saw anything that stood out i never had any real problems aside from the usually odd jump mechanics which are better in this title than the title that came before black flag and easy to adjust to anyhow it plays smoothly has decent enough graphics and unlimited baddies to wack if your feeling blood thirsty it can be a little grindy for some folks but with so much to do i didn 't really notice also no serious gamer is a fan of u -play imo but otherwise i really have no complaints even then u -play at least allows you to share rare finds with friends which is an interesting feature black flag is an atmospheric ac game that won 't feel very linear as there is tons to do and it makes use of it 's rather open world quite well i 've had loads of fun with it and i highly reccomend it long verision ever played an assassin 's creed game and got frustrated with with the limits of the asassin code i did thank god for black flag ac games can be a hit or a miss but even in the good ones sometimes you are left going 'for crying out loud i 'm an assassin what care i about the common folk in older titles it seems like for every enemy its okay to kill there seems to be 20 civillans in the way and well mistakes happen mistakes that would cost you because the commoners tend to get in the way well you might not get to stab a bunch of innocents in this verision of ac ethier but for once you won 't notice black flag is definitely a title for those who want to cut loose the civillans rarely get in the way here they are spaced out nicely while still feeling kind of like a dense population and there are baddies a plenty the hero character of the hour edward is also not your typical assassin from the order he cares a whole lot less about all that honor talk perferring the sound money makes he has no qualms about killing for some coin and he gets away with it why in ac :bf you play as a pirate who is pretending to be one of the assassins and therefore is not fully bound by the code and when i say your not bound i mean by the assassin 's code or anything else black flag isn 't just about hunting that templar scum sure it 's in there but as a sailor you soon will find you have wide swaths of ocean to travel with plenty of side actitvies to do some of which are locked behind story missions yes but the game gets rolling quickly and everything is open fairly early on without ruining progression want to upgrade your weapons go for it but you 'll want to hunt that animal down to do it after all you need it 's skin and different animals means areas of travel and tactic want to hunt a whale well are your harpoons up to snuff what about your rowboat for that matter what about your main ship is it strong enough to face the might of the sea you do want to loot miltary ships of all that heavy gold sugar cannon shot and metal don 't you or were you just after boarding the scuttled enemy ship so you could fight them hand to hand walking amongst them like the god of death your feared to be well then you better buy a decent sword and cloak to look the part and did i mention the songs your crew will sing as you sail the ocean which you have to chase down to unlock what about the forts you can wage battle against or the ability to dock into a town and go hunting for soliders or raiding stock houses what about a trading mini -game that allows you to capture ships and make them work for you in real time it 's a good way to make some coin while your working that 9 to 5 job that paid for the game in the first place but then maybe your just a landlubber who likes to gamble on british checkers yeah it has that too all the while the usual ac goodies are there in the missions with a decent story and some fun sneakiness if you want it yes if you want it most of the missions don 't require you to be sneaky it 's a bonus nothing more but might make things easier on you if your smart about it black flag typically lets you play your way plus did i mention treasure hunts because what is a pirate without some buried tresure maps on the modern day side of the story your a promising intern at astergo entertainment so when you want to step out of the animus (your simulator and go back to modern day that 's fine too it has it 's own little story to tell which leads to several easter eggs from the older ac titles making black flag a great game to start on if your a little behind or even new to the assassin 's creed games
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'optimization', 'series', 'graphics', 'movement']",assassin 's creed iv black flag sailed in on a wave of hype before it was released it was the perfect storm of combining the ninja -like abilities of the assassins with the pirate life of the caribbean in the early 18th century the game became more open -world with a large open ocean to explore and sail islands ruins and cities to explore whaling to be done shipwrecks to search and the adventure seemed endless after the newness of this game wears off however the game quickly turns into a grindfest and a lot of the excitement is gone replaced by monotonous tedium the person no longer takes on the role of desmond  who was killed at the end of assassin 's creed iii  but instead becomes a faceless voiceless worker at abstergo entertainment a company working to turn the animus adventures into adventures for the average consumer your job is to explore the life of edward kenway (hatham and connor 's ancestor to turn into footage for a game about life in the caribbean of course the whole thing turns out to be another search for an old -world artifact the observatory which has the power to change the world edward who is neither assassin nor templar is just a puckish rogue who wants to make a fortune on the high seas after having your previous ship destroyed you chance upon an assassin duncan walpole who was on one of the ships in the other side of the engagement after chasing down killing and assuming duncan 's identity as an assassin edward goes on his journey to find the observatory as stated before the game goes from exciting exploring the caribbean and being introduced to the world to having to grind a bunch of resources to upgrade your ship and your gear the game also doesn 't even give you one of the tools in your arsenal until very late in the game (and by the time you 're given the tool you use it for 2 missions and it 's really not useful beyond that ubisoft still hasn 't fixed the horrendous control issues that plague the ac franchise in its 6th game of the series i don 't know how many times i would be looking at something to jump to and the game would pick some arbitrary point in a completely different direction to send me the game also loved to have me air assassinate a target on the ground rather than knock out a tranquilized enemy right next to me for whatever bizarre reason when that air assassination forces you to have to replay a large chunk of the mission over again it gets frustrating the ending of the game felt really rushed rather than coming to a satisfying conclusion the whole end sequence was more an exercise in patience rather than a real honest -to-goodness boss battle as the level shifts and changes and you just sit and wait for it to get into the next position so you can proceed by the end of the game i was angry frustrated and beyond ready for the game to end although with all of its faults asscreed 4 was still fun you just need a ton of patience and be ready to forgive the game for all the dumb decisions it 's going to have you make for instance the game thinks that if you 're in a place to jump up to the top area of a mast but also in a position to jump down 100 feet and almost kill yourself the obvious choice that a normal person would make would be to jump down 100 feet and almost kill yourself *facepalm* final verdict 7 /10 [final edit the game is also locked at 30 fps on pc for whatever reason no real excuse for that my computer can handle the game at 60 fps easily

"['graphics', 'exploration', 'combat', 'stealth', 'series', 'storyline', 'uplay', 'entertainment value']",rating 9 /10 genre open world -action/adventure the good great graphics the game offers plenty of variety in gameplay between main missions side missions assassin contracts collectables searching for buried treasure and some minor stealth missions your ship the jackdaw is equally impressive sailing the high seas feels amazing navigating turbulent waves sailing through a tropical storm avoiding massive tornados all while trying to sink or commandeer enemy ships you can also attack navy forts accept navy contracts hunt for sharks or whales the jackdaw can be upgraded with money and resources acquired from other ships allowing you to attack larger more dangerous ships for more resources and loot combat itself feels fantastic allowing you to use canons swivels or mortars cause enough damage to a ship and you can either board it with your crew or sink it the main missions are fun and offer enough variety and challenge to keep you playing every main mission has 2 bonus objectives for those looking for a further challenge i also like how ubisoft got a bit more creative with the main story as the other games before it was following the same standard story template the average +/- the combat is decent but often feels like a lesser version of rocksteady ’s batman games i never felt like the different swords and pistols made all that much of a difference i usually just stood still waiting for an enemy to attack counter it and then killed him rinse and repeat +/- requires uplay conclusion i ’ve been waiting to play a good pirate game for a very long time and this game scratches that itch this is one of my favorite open world games i ’ve played just by the sheer amount of content and variety provided a must play for any open world enthusiast
"['pirate theme', 'storyline']",if you like pirates it 's a must play the gameplay is very repetitive though i had 89 completion when i finally beat it sailing around listening to sea shanties was by far my favorite part of this game best asscreed game i 've played other than maybe ac2 but this one is my favorite for the pirate setting
"['uplay', 'series']","steam and ubisoft need to get their act together to improve the way all of the assassin 's creed franchise are advertised and activated on steam firstly clarification needs to be given to what extras add -ons and dlcs you get with each version of each game 'standard', 'deluxe' and 'season's pass for example i purchased the 'digital deluxe version of ac iv black flag (the most expensive thinking i would get the adewale single -player add -on included i didn 't. so what exactly is the difference between the 'digital deluxe edition and the 'season's pass edition adewale is included in the 'season's pass edition even though it 's cheaper wtf secondly buyers should be told clearly that they need to make sure that all of the steam cd keys have been activated in uplay as well  as in steam otherwise the extras / add -ons / dlcs will not show up in the game the way the ac franchise is advertised on steam at the moment is a nightmare for anyone who wants to figure out exactly what they 'll be getting for their money it 's just completely confusing"

['series'],best assassin 's creed game
"['pirate theme', 'series']",huge world charismatic captain edward kenway very close gameplay to the previous ac games while the setting is a bit different the ship battles add a nice layer and a change of pace which makes this game the best in the series since ac2 pirating was never this cool
"['graphics', 'optimization', 'combat', 'storyline', 'series']","black flags is a ac game and has bugs because ubisoft if you are having a v sync issues or stuttering with constant drops to 30fps there is a fix and it gives you alittle more performance as well you can either use the best method by pressing windows key +l to lock windows then unlock go back into game which gives you about 10 performance boost and runs smooth as butter or run the game as admin with vsync and triple buffering conrtolled by the gpu but you will still get some frame drops here and there but it fixes the drops to 30fps another issue you may get is freezing for a few seconds while sailing this is a glitch caused by fxaa so don 't use it also smaa blurs the water while moving i recomend using your gpu pannel for aa or msaa now to my review black flag is not a normal creed game mostly because its amazing and no game with an 'animus' in the story should be called amazing the other ac games are good don 't get me wrong i like them alot but not gta fallout elder scrolls witcher good black flag is nearly just that the mechanics in the game are polished and open exluding a few bugs the graphics are top notch for 2013 as well and with sweetfx and 4k it holds up great the naval combat is a blast :p, and the melee combat is great my only gripe is it is restricted to typicall ac themes i .e. don 't be killing civilians no taking someone elses ship and building that one up limited to what weapons you can hold on to i am a pirate so i should be swashbuckling stabby cut throat whore mongering drunkard fun the story is ok but sometimes unbearably in accurate how they portray real pirates (simular to aciii with its horrible geography and historic figures and they are just there to move the plot black beard is nothing like he was in real life this is a 6 ,5'+ 280 pound man who left his crew to die by grounding the queen annes revenge to keep the money for himself ubisoft portrays him as average size fairly nice inept at piracy and loyal person don 't even get me started on black bart .the whole animus thing is bearley a discussion and is still needless they could have just made it you are a pirate go and pirate things no need for the same old story of made up blah blah in historical localations but the open world lets you forget about that though you can never get a new ship or are able to capture one which is a real shame though you can upgrade the ship with the world being so big and grand and your crew singing while you sail its easy to get sucked in (songs like leave her johnny drunken sailor and fathom the bowel i find myself singing at times to some odd looks from people the mini games are a lot of fun and at times i just like to play a game of checkers while listening to the 'live band who will play period music .(and each region gets their own songs based on the inhabitants like an english settlement will play old english and irish songs like all for my grog another gripe i do have for this game is its a bear to run most are lucky to see 30fps @high res ultra i modded it and it tends to run around 45 -50fps at 1080p with high on everything but shadows with an i7 2gb nvidia and 16gigs ram so make sure you can run it if you are on a lower end machine or laptop a 980ti will muscle it at 1440p at 60fps with sweet fx but the gameworks features will need to be off because its gameworks to maintain 60 100 of the time i need to drop a few setting down to very high even on a 980ti for a 1080ti 4k is easily attainable but you will need to ajust your settings no joke this is one of the most stressful games to run with all of it 's pc features black flag is the one of two games of the series that was developed on pc then ported .(aciii bring the other which is odd it still has bugs given it was made for pc since it was developed for pc it has a wide array of graphic options with many different setting to them i guess none of this is surprising seeing how with aciii ubi forgot to add a resolution option in game this is a game i would highly recommend to people who even hate the series because this pirate game shouldn 't of bothered with the name assassins creed no it is to good this is just black flag to me and black flag is great oh and for some reason i always seem to play this when i 've had a few it just makes the debauchery better i think"

"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'assassin theme', 'character', 'entertainment value']",just another great ac game in this outing we get to liberate slaves which fires me up and makes me merciless when dealing with the overseers and the soldiers i can buy them all liberate the rest and they volunteer on my ship it 's brilliant graphics and fantastic oceans naval battles are a tad complicated but it 's worth it recuing sailors is also a cool thing if you love assassins creed then this one will not disappoint the hardcore or newbie alike
"['storyline', 'assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'graphics', 'combat', 'optimization', 'movement', 'customer support']",black flag is a certain success certain but not complete the best word i have to describe that game is 'inconsistent'. after the questionable third volume of the assassin 's creed franchise which was supposedly the last in the story ac iv should have been very bright sparkling with the story the main character the combination of all already invented game mechanics and a good addition of newer ones it was really supposed to add something fascinating to the assassin 's creed universe ubisoft crafted one of the greatest and interesting games with the 'pirates' topic and some even say 'the best pirate game of all with that they failed to recollect the loose ends of that precious yet quite a dubious creed of assassins speaking ahead in the next game of the serial the rogue ubisoft went even forward with messing the cornerstones and adding as much blur to the main ac story as possible what was intriguing and inspiring at the first and second volumes of the franchise the inheritance of the former race the main quest to save the world from global apocalypse all that becomes quite gaudy and messy to the point when none care about the main quest at all oh well let 's cut the story in the end it just dropped hard and shattered to bits and pieces spoiling the overall impression even worse than the end of the mass effect iii as of the black flag in general though it is normal and even delightful open -world ubisoft game with the robbers from the main road posed as valiant knights in their crusade only with such goals to fulfill as the thirst for gold and blood and fear and without the shadow of vengeance for their misdeeds you may assume now what i 'm not so high with pirates as 'good guys well i 'm not high about the killing in the first place but that can 't stop me from admiring the assassin 's creed serial for the impact on the gaming world that ubisoft originally made so yeah with all said black flag is a damn -good gaming experience with intense action both on the land and on the sea great naval battles the chests with gold and other prizes spread along with the big territory of west india black flag is one fine adventure it has some flaws sure the main story and some of the game features quite illogical and even spoiled like hunting with the hidden blade before you acquire one like the quests from assassins which you can take right after arriving in the first city a friggin year before the story actually tells you to do so and with that the diving sequences (which would be so natural to free -riding adventurer before he messed with assassins comes closer to the end of the game plot in my game i 've conquered all the forts sank one of the legendary ships and done about 80 of other free -riding before i was permitted to finally bought the diving bell it is so messed in my book that only non -explicit word i have about it is 'inconsistent'. yeah i said that already i know i know some major glitches are known from ac iii and even previous titles disappearing ships leaving big holes into the water for example or people stacking into supposedly solid structures like walls and roofs sometimes during the missions you can try to perform something supposedly legal by game 's rules but not lined into the given quest scripts like jumping into other bush than you were aimed to the game crushes sweet right well with all said i 'm still highly recommend the black flag even if you 're not down with all that assassin 's creed fuss that game stands aside it 's a fairytale 'bout pirates rum treasures and exceptional bravery of the seamen with glorious naval battles and very complex (even if a bit unstable open -world experience my mark is 8 .7/10 i 've enjoyed almost everything but the occasional (not frequent bugs and bits of logical flaws here and there during my gameplay ps as of dlc freedom cry take it if you have a thing in saving black people from chains (even if it gets repetitive quite fast or if you enjoy the melee combat by ac rules as there will be new and fine moves with a big mean machete if only there were decapitations in the fighting engine adewale would be a perfect resemblance to the 'machete' movie blunderbuss is a cool thing to wield as well yarr just don 't expect from freedom cry the deepness even on the level with revelations it 's just a short dlc campaign for a black assassin saving his people from slavery worth 6 .9/10 mark i guess
"['series', 'combat', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'uplay', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'customer support']",as a long time assassin 's creed fan i must say i had my doubts for this particular title with assassin 's creed 2 and brotherhood alike being my all time fave ac titles i was rather spektical about this at first the whole idea of how naval combat in ac3 was horrible and made me rather avoid this title but thankfully i took my chances and played this it is absolutely incredible simply amazing the gameplay like previous ac titles is well worked and serves a great time while it follows the same idea of counter killing just about anyone via combat remains classic and at it 's finest naval combat has been refined in an amazing way that made me simply love it compared to ac3 's naval combat edward is a real fun character altogh he seems like the worst assassin at first he appears to have a much better liking than connor the story is fun intresting and all around enjoyable map is huge no need to explain on that detail it 's big no other word needed like any other ac games it can have some humerous but only sometimes game breaking glitches ubisoft get your head straigth please unity just shows how much people can stand your slackering people tend to hate uplay and i actually did at first but hey it 's not that horrible as long as i don 't have to use it to actually get in my games so for all i care i just ignore it when the game finally installs great pc port just love it solid 60 frames nonstop assassin 's creed iv black flag is an amazing title it serves the idea of a good game for both ac fans and non ac fans while this may not be your typical 'loyal to the creed against the templar 's type of game it well enough deserves a top spot in the franchise and sits very well with the legacy ac2 holds all in all i 'd give assassin 's creed black flag a 9 .7/10 a must have if you enjoy these types of open world games
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'combat', 'series']",absolutely breathtaking is a very good way of describing assassin ’s creed iv black flag from my experience at least i ’m very happy that ubisoft decided to go back in time to a very interesting period in history the golden age of piracy not only does this game visit a stunning caribbean setting but there are also numerous enhancements to the gameplay and graphics i ’ve put about 30 hours into it so far and i ’m 60 towards total completion in black flag you can sail your own pirate ship and explore a vast caribbean sandbox consisting of uncharted islands shipwrecks and 3 major cities there ’s a vast open ocean to travel across but the new convenient fast travel system has eliminated the annoyances of fast travel in the previous games (such as finding a fast travel point in order to fast travel now after discovering a location you can quickly travel there at any time you wish each of the cities is different in its style and residents visiting each of them gave me the feeling that i was visiting a different part of the world havana has the spanish theme kingston has the english theme and nassau has the pirate theme i was very impressed with the amount of detail put into each location and this can be said for the more remote areas such as the jungles and beaches a lot of work was put into making the environments feel genuine the gameplay has been slightly improved since assassin ’s creed iii there are many new tools to use (some are really neat and new animations for fighting sequences the enemies feel more dangerous than they did in previous games which are good because i always found the combat to be a little too easy :p black flag has made sure to keep the fights challenging the graphics are another point worth mentioning the anvil -next engine looks even better than it did in assassin ’s creed iii which is to be expected but it went above my expectations the new weather system features full night and day cycles complete with the most intense storms i ’ve ever seen in games nvidia users get the full experience with txaa anti -aliasing and improved physx though radeon users still have a great looking game a big reason i bought this game was because of the story which is aaa quality as usual the templar twist in assassin ’s creed iii still beats anything that black flag has thrown at me but that doesn 't mean i ’m disappointed there are many famous pirates that some history buffs will go crazy over your character edward has one hell of a journey turning from pirate to assassin and even plays a templar for a while it ’s very well thought out with real events being tied into fictional events part of the assassin ’s creed universe there ’s so much more for me to talk about but if anyone has made it this far you ’ll probably be sick of this fan boy rant if you enjoy the series you won ’t need this review if you ’re unsure i would take a risk and buy it there ’s so much to do and a great story to boot
"['storyline', 'combat']",best assassin 's creed by far story is so -so but the excitement of the navel combat more than makes up for it legitamitely one of the only games where the vehicle sections are my favorite part
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'music']",an enjoyable assassin 's creed game but also an absolutely phenomenal 'pirate' game as well all of the things you enjoy about ac games are here with a new tropical setting that stands out from previous ac games the naval element to the game is incredible also anything you 'd want to do as a pirate is here you swashbuckler you digging for treasure swinging aboard destabilized enemy galleons drinking rum to excess wrestling gators with your bare hands listening to your crewmen sing shanties as you splash your way through the open sea having chats with blackbeard kidd and hornigold i enjoyed black flag more than ac3 while it might be lacking the historical elements that ac1 and 2 had it makes up for it with sheer enjoyment in the game play yar give it a go matey
"['series', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'stealth', 'movement', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",black flag is probably the best assassin 's creed game in the franchise from a fun perspective i played it back on the 360 in 2013 and it still holds up in 2020 its got a wide arsenal of weapons to use being 2 swords 4 pistols 2 hidden blades a blowpipe with 2 different ammo types and a rope dart plus a entire ship to customize and attack and board other ships its also super fun to explore the caribbean while your crew sing shanties and whales surface giving a cool vibe the combat itself is a little basic and you can pretty much kill anything from the very beginning but i still think its a pretty fun combat loop and edward fights brutally the parkour is pretty easy so you can turn your brain off (kinda good kinda bad depending on how you see that the story i think is pretty interesting and the characters are probably the best in any ac game blackbeard kidd and edward being the standouts with their performances the only 'bad' parts i can say is really the modern day sections but they 're so short it doesnt really get in the way of doing pirate stuff and outside of certain story moments you wont be in the first person modern day parts often if ever overall id say its 9 /10 but a 10 /10 on the fun scale
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",do you like pirates do you like assassin 's creed well this is probably the game for you having said that the game does not really feel like assassin 's creed it is essentially a full -on pirate game pros good pirate feel nice visuals and soundtrack good naval combat and boarding etc cons the usual fps issues (fine in parts but with random drops not much assassin 's creed to it all in all i 'd recommend it more as a pirate game if you want assassin 's creed go back to ac2 etc
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'combat', 'movement', 'graphics']",this is assassin 's creed there 's a big map with a bunch of icons you go to those icons and do things like watch cutscenes assassinate people and hoard items there are parkour sequences what makes this one better than the other titles in the series its setting is gorgeous and fun the caribbean islands are presented beautifully and you get to be a pirate you sail on a ship singing sea shanties and siring cannons sorry 'firing' cannons the cannons fire in an arc and land where you put your target when you arrive on land again you are bothered by the fact that the floor is stable stupid floor there you can run across roof tops shove as many people as you like and dive into haystacks and then you get to shoot people which is very satisfying when you don 't feel like getting into melee combat like other assassin 's creed games there 's a meta -story going on outside the animus in this one you get to run around an office being 'that guy and making everyone hate their lives i did not finish the game but i still left satisfied highly recommended
['no topic'],still amazing even in the year of 2020 while new versions and games are uprising nothing can beat the classics
"['series', 'combat', 'optimization', 'character', 'music']","this one is one of my 3 fav series in franchise with assassin 's creed ii and assassin 's creed brotherhood pros -fighting system (started from ac3 -no more complicated crafting windows -grand theft boat (except you only stay on your own ship -charismatic main hero -kenway's fleet (you send your fleet on missions and they bring you stuff -interesting main story sequences quite differ from each other by mood locations and by things you do unlike in ac1 /ac3 (where you basically hunt each templar per sequence -thank god no more 'wanted' system (on lands that means no more killing witnesses bribing heralds and removing poster every 3 minutes -awesome 'wanted' system on the sea kill boats kill bigger boats (bigger rewards kill even bigger boats (even bigger rewards and when you 've had enough turn off pirate hunters by bribing dudes on the lands -a lot of upgrades for edward and jackdaw but sometimes they require you to find special recipes -soundtracks (personally i love all assassin 's creed games soundtracks cons for all ac game -overstretched gameplay by missions where -you have to quietely follow dudes -you have to take a f ***ing walk with npcs -viewpoints (srsly i hate them i usually try to visit all viewpoints in the beginning of the game cons specifically for acbf -bad optimisation (srsly, system req says nvidia geforce gtx 470 mine 's is a twice of efficient and still 40 fps in big places (cities, jungles etc but even worse has ac unity -no more desmond 's adventures :/, starting from black flag the present day scenes go worse and worse multiplayer (i really suck at it so i don 't want to judge it -that's a very different expirience no more waiting around you mostly have like 1 minute to live -custom game modes where you can fully customize session rules and by fully i mean really fully (e.g make a game where only rifles are allowed i suggest you buy console version or this one if you have latest gen graphic card for 60 fps performance"
"['storyline', 'graphics']",simply put this game is amazing but has some places where it can make this amazing game even greater the storyline is very immersive and lengthy and features a great and authientic cast of characters the ship you have under your command can be upgraded with things such as better broadside cannons mortars swivel guns rams etc the ship feels as though it has a realistic amount of weight the cities feel authentic there was a direct link between ac bf and ac3 what i don `t like glitches grind elsewhere you can `t to finish the storyline 9 /10
"['optimization', 'uplay', 'customer support']",look this is a great game but if you 're getting it on pc understand you 're playing a game of russian roulette with it this game has multiple tech issues i 've experienced constant crashing when turning on aa god rays anything other than low shadows etc etc this is odd because i 've got a powerful rig that has the game on maxed textures and plays numerous others maxed out with those options enabled but sure whatever we 'll say something is wrong with my computer and not bf there 's also the issue that if you use uplay 's cloud saving the game will eat your save causing you to lose hours of progress i personally lost five hours of progress this even happend to a previewer on rockpapershotgun checking the forums others have lost completed games with the average loss being 8 hours some users insist this continues after turning off cloud saves so back up your saves too there 's also the issue i may have had that this game may not play nice if you don 't install it on the same drive with your windows install although this seems to be true for other ubi titles (like blacklist (i can 't pinpoint this one for me because i reinstalled and also changed graphic options at the same time which stopped crashing but which one fixed it but other forumers have the drive issue and some users (thankfully not me have the game crash on the splash screen also if you have a laptop apparently this game doesn 't play nice with those and the integrated graphics cards involved so do your research don 't know much about that one currently using a desktop this is a great game the gameplay is rock solid but i can 't recommend it in good consciouscience because i don 't want anyone to buy it or worse gift it and not have it work that 's an awful frustrating feeling and i don 't want anyone to feel like i did so no the other reviewers are not wrong for recommending it their time has been positive mine hasn 't. it just is what it is it 's part of the baggage of pc gaming and it rears its ugly head now -and-then. however make sure you turn off cloud saving no matter who you are and back up your saves this is a nasty bug for uplay that doesn 't care how great your machine is imagine doing all the sync points or collecting all the collectibles on mutliple islands only to lose them it sure stinks
"['entertainment value', 'character', 'storyline', 'combat', 'movement', 'customer support']","+pros -great, beautiful open world with a lot to do -great character customization -decent story with satisfying ending -great characters relatable protagonist -naval battle is engaging and fun -player housing is always fun -interesting gadget (op darts -treasure hunt is pretty fun -storming forts +cons -boring stiff melee combat you can only attack if you “go” into combat camera angle and only to highlighted enemy and often interrupted before finish the combo and weapon damage is not relevant because if your combo is interrupted then you have to do that all over again and finally press “e” to win -dumb and lazy ai there is only 4 type of ai in every faction the goon sniper officer and heavy and you do the same thing for any of them every time there is really no variation and freedom -there is many boring mission it ’s like 70 of them is trailing and eavesdropping -boring cities the difference is spanish speaking city and english speaking city -lack of side quest the side “activities” is great but i guess this is too much to ask because this is not rpg -modern time line is always boring but hacking every pc is alright -hunting is too easy beside you can just buy them at weapon shop for a cheap price anyway -storm is not fun and it ’s happen like every 10 -15 min i understand this review is pretty heavy handed but i can only criticize the thing that annoying me"
['storyline'],made me cry at the end 10 /10.
['no topic'],i let my gametime speak for itself
['no topic'],edit as of 15 december the issue appears to be resolved i 'm switching this to a positive review as i do quite like the game although it 's a real pity that it 's tied to ubisoft 's notoriously anti -consumer practices anyone considering buying this be advised as of right now 12 december 2022 the game 's servers have been down for several days and it is not possible to complete the game approximately 20 of the way through the single -player campaign there is a mission that requires online connectivity that currently cannot be completed your campaign will stop at that point ubisoft has been silent on this issue so far and there 's no sign of a fix in progress i love the game and have 100 %ed it multiple times in the past but at present i feel obligated to warn against purchasing it i will delete this review if the issue is ever resolved so if you 're reading this assume that you will be greatly disappointed by your purchase
"['graphics', 'stealth', 'movement', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'series', 'optimization', 'combat', 'customer support']","2020 honest review   aspect reviews   graphics 2013 games quite impressive for 7 years old game .   gameplay still stealth and parkour ubisoft added naval battles and you can board or sink enemy 's ship they also added kenway 's fleet which is a mini -game for getting in -game currency and some collectibles not many choices of weapons and guns but they added rope dart (this one sick af swimming mechanism a little bit too hard for me sometimes frustrating this is the most unique titles in ac franchise hopefully skull bones will become 'black flag 2 without assassination thing .   story historically accurate enough although it 's not 100 accurate i love they made stories for flying gang (edward thatch aka blackbeard ben hornigold charles vane calico jack rackham stede bonnet anne bonny and mary read aka james kidd this is just story about golden age of piracy in carribean i read stories of em when i was teenager .   price cheap but get the bundle 4 titles in order .   system requirements  meh, just 2013 game stable 60 fps with rx 580 .   bugs crash once not a problem but i need to set the lowest anti aliasing if not i couldn 't run the campaign (only black screen and not responding ).   patch updates  no more updates .   others happy pirating but don 't pirate the game !   overall 9 /10. enjoyed this game so much around 50hrs with 95 completion too tired to get 100 completion"
"['pirate theme', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'movement', 'music', 'stealth', 'errors']",assassin 's creed black flag was an awesome adventure set during the golden age of piracy it still remains one of my favourite settings in the assassin 's creed franchise to date pros +excellent graphics the islands of the caribbean are rendered in beautiful detail down to the wildlife which inhabit them +great story edward is one of the more likable protagonists in the series and his motives are very relatable even as he struggles with doing the right thing +great open -world gameplay with awesome naval battles ability to upgrade your ship and explore islands along with underwater shipwrecks +great controls when in combat prowling the seas in your ship or when traversing the in -game environment to persue enemies +great orchestral soundtrack as well as entertaining sea shanties which your crew sing as you sail across the seas +anne bonny <3 cons -experienced one glitch during my entire playthrough when my ship became a submarine while sailing to africa during one of the missions -stealth could use some work especially during some missions where you have to tail enemies it could be a bit annoying

"['series', 'character', 'storyline']","this game is almost brilliant in all the ways it could possibly be new revamped open -world, new colourful characters good old gameplay mechanics as well as new ones everything works out and everything suits the assassin's creed  saga i am a bit disappointed that there 's too much taken from acii (just again rather than ac or aciii. however i enjoy the game and i sense it 's great potential for the rest of the season with all the dlc and side -activites like ac initiates ."
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'music', 'exploration']",quality storyline beautiful music cool ships fun exploration
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'series']",finished the story like 3 or 4 times never gets old love it installing again for one more time with a few new dlc 's. assassin ’s creed iv black flag is an awesome game with a great story it has great combat both naval and when dueling the end of the game content and side quests are great the side missions and exploration are great offering stories of their own and allowing you to make your own story really recomend this game

['customer support'],i decided to delete my earlier review and write this one as i can no longer recommend this game due to ubisoft and uplay first after 56 hours of game play my save game was lost i did some research and found out a lot of people have this issue i decided to open a support ticket with ubisoft so i logged in to their support site i went through the 'submit a question option to explain the issue when i click submit it take me to a list of possible solutions none of which are even close and says if these dont fix your issue click submit only the submit button does nothing i click on 'my questions only to have no new questions there i tried this three times and could not submit a question i then went to the ubisoft technical support forum to post about the black flag issue and the submit a question issue i typed out my new post and tried to 'submit' it it tells me i have to choose a 'thread prefix so i choose one from their drop down box and click submit it blanks out my thread prefix and tells me i have to choose a thread prefix i think maybe this is a bug because i didn 't have a thread prefix selected when i first submitted i retype the entire post choose a prefix and click 'submit' only for the forum to blank out my thread prefix and tell me i need to choose a thread prefix i finally had to reply to someone else complaing thread because i could not create my own uplay and ubisoft have forced me to change my review as i do not want my friends to have to go through this crap
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",pretty decent assassin 's creed game amazing pirate game

"['errors', 'optimization', 'uplay', 'series', 'customer support']",hey there steam users if you recently tried to replay or play for the 1st time the 10 year old game assassin 's creeds black flag well you 're in luck because game is :steamsalty: buggy af all dlcs or some of them won 't work fps issues crashes etc etc let me save you some time after you send a few tickets to to ubisoft support website they will tell you that their team of devs are working really hard to fix your problem because you the player are their main priority in reality some of the issues have been around for months and they are not being fixed or they are low priority maybe because it 's a 10 year old game or maybe because they are trying to shift away from steam and force you to go on they 're platform solution refund dlcs and play the base game only if you must or complain here <eu consumer protection agency i 'm not advocating to play the cracked version but that one works like on release day good luck
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'combat', 'exploration', 'stealth', 'movement', 'music', 'optimization']",assassin 's creed iv black flag is a sequel to assassin 's creed iii (the reason it is a sequel has to do with modern -day storyline this game goes one century back in 17th century during the 'golden age of piracy as you play as edward kenway the father of haytham kenway thus the grandfather of ratonhnhaké :ton/connor (the protagonist of assassin 's creed iii  the setting is beautifully made with realistic looking oceans and breathtaking landscapes the color and beauty is quite well made it feels like the beauty i once saw in assassin 's creed ii each major locations look unique to each other for example havana has blockly colorish clay houses with sandy streets nassau looks like a jungle mix with towns and kingston has colorful yet similar buildings like the ones in assassin 's creed iii everything is made pretty darn well  it has retain the same concepts in assassin 's creed iii but much more improved hiding in bushes will not always protect you now as enemies will not only search bushes but can spot you quickly if they are near enough to see you combat system has been improved and difficulty is balanced the new free -aim system works very well and bodyshooting enemies will not always kill them so headshots are mostly necessary and reloading the gun (s) are quick and easy there are changes for the enemies combat as well they have the ability to tackle you down during a chase enemies such as scouts and captains can attack you in free flow combat similar to what connor does in assassin 's creed iii sharpshooters tend to shoot at you from above and stays there even if you are hiding the stealth system seems to have improved and for me it was enjoyable naval combat is the key in this game edward 's ship the jackdaw will be greatly relied on and if you enjoyed naval combat in assassin 's creed iii then you will love this as well your ship can shoot cannons with correct aiming swivel guns aim perfectly you can shoot fire barrels from behind and shoot chain shots from the front and with some more upgrades you can use mortars and upgraded rams these are useful when fighting tougher ships like man o wars you can now plunder ships when the ship is damaged enough no cutscenes play during the plundering and moments like these are great the wanted system will not apply on land however it will apply on the sea as long as you keep plundering ships your noteriety will increase which will result pirate hunters to go after you the higher the noteriety the bigger the ship (s) will come and more difficult it becomes the crafting system is encouraged so you may have more guns to carry more health to gain more ammo to hold and so on you can craft simply through the pause menu you need materials which leads to hunting which encouraged to hunt animals such as iguanas deers monkeys and even crocodiles if you go further you can even hunt sea creatures such as hammerhead sharks great white sharks humpback whales killer whales and if you are lucky a white whale assassin 's creed iv has also introduced underwater exploring for the first time in the series which you use a diving bell to explore and gain treasures in the deep ocean while avoiding dangerous animals such as great white sharks jellyfishes sea urchins and moray eels you can avoid them by gaining oxygen through barrels or diving bells or hiding in seaweed (be careful as it may contain a moray eel  there are some bugs that i encounter but was never interfering with my gameplay i must say though this sort of bug is the most oddest and most epic bug i have ever seen in a game sometimes you will have a hole in the water ...and...well...lets just say ...your sailors might ...go to heaven and the jackdaw rises from the sea or your ship is at the air and will go down quickly like crazy as if peter -pan was trolling edward it was the most hilarious bug i have ever seen in my lifetime don 't let this discourage you the game is still good to play regarding if it is pc optimized i cannot say i ran the game well with my 780m card at the highest settings possible but i cannot say the same for others this game improved greatly from its predecessor and i recommend it attempt to pay attention closely to the plot of both modern day and 17th century as it plays one heck of a major role for the next game additional notes i have finished the game with 100 synchronization this is a review for single -player only please be aware that i am reviewing the game itself not the ubisoft launcher or anything that has nothing to do with the game unless it is necessary to be said this game is played on my laptop intel core i7 4700mq 8 gb ram 1 tb 7200 rpm hard drive nvidia geforce gtx 780m 4 gb bigfoot killer wireless -n 1103
"['pirate theme', 'exploration', 'combat', 'character', 'entertainment value', 'music']",they don't make pirate games like they used to which is a big shame because this is obviously the best of the best this game has tons of things to do to keep you occupied simple but intense ship battles underwater exploring ship and character customization hunting and plenty of weapons and upgrades that will make you the king of the caribbean best pirate game ever the only complaint i can think of is that there's no option to switch the game's soundtrack with the pirates of the caribbean's.
"['series', 'combat', 'exploration', 'optimization', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",this game might be the best of the franchise it combines the elements of assassin 's creed 3 's ship battles and the classic assassin mechanics the rpg elements of the ship are good since you have to go attack other ships in order to find your required materials there is a lot of content in this game missions assassin contracts and a lot of collectibles scattered throughout cities and uncharted locations such as islands or jungles the true pirate experience and maybe this isn 't too true to the assassin 's creed series but who gives a bottle of rum it 's awesome if you wait for a sale to come up for this game get it immediately if not get it anyway 10 /10
"['pirate theme', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",best ac franchise wasting my time just for sailing around nowhere enjoying the view 'prepare the jackdaw *brace for impact aye captain

"['storyline', 'graphics', 'music', 'details', 'gameplay', 'optimization', 'bugs', 'uplay']",my purchases assassin 's creed black flag gold edition my scores for this game story 9 /10 the story was more of a pirate story than an assassin 's creed but overall it was a beautiful story graphics */10 i prefer not to comment on the graphics because the game was not optimal for me and the graphics settings did not work well for me musics sound 10 /10 i also enjoyed the music of this assassin 's creed details 10 /10 the details were great especially the details of being a pirate and being a pirate  gameplay 9 /10 the gameplay was great but it can be repeated after a few hours of play but the naval battles section was great variety 10 /10 too much variety because the game was not optimal i could not play too much characterization 10 /10 i did not see any flaws in the character building all the characters were made with great care optimization 4 /10 in each game setting it was 10 -50 fps i did not get any results with any help on the internet multiplayer 1 /10 it did not run at all and it crashed bugs i saw a lot of bugs but not too many note need to connect ubisoftconnect description after finishing ac iii i realized that ac iv is the past haytham and i heard a lot of definitions of this game i downloaded the game with a lot of excitement the only drawback that bothered me was that the game was not optimal extra assassins creed freedom cry hd (dlc) overall score 9 .5/10 i recommend only the game has an optimal problem

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'graphics', 'music']","competent, but not outstanding . summary: braving giant waves amid a storm launching a naval assault on an island fort going toe -to-toe with a spanish man -o-war: these are the kind of pirate adventures we dream of when we 're young assassin's creed iv black flag  brings these and more to life often accompanied by hearty sea shanties but it also carries with it the more monotonous side of sea life this isn 't grand theft auto ; there aren 't alleys to race through jumps to go off of or really much of anything to avoid crashing into there are plenty of cannons to fire but i 'd be lying if i said it didn 't get boring everything else you 've come to expect from an assassin's creed  game is also on display here there 's fluid foot travel wonderfully realized caribbean islands dotting the ocean waves and iconic historic figures pulled into the game 's fiction our protagonist edward kenway is charismatic and faces some unique challenges along his journey he 's also enough of a true pirate that it can be hard to root for him at times the story has some powerful moments but on the whole felt disjointed to me i recommend assassin's creed iv black flag , but don 't let the glowing reviews out there fool you into thinking it 's vastly different or better than previous games in the series full review : assassin's creed 's signature parkour locomotion is as liberating as ever here the caribbean doesn doesn 't have the kind of stately cities that europe does but the lush jungles seaside fishing villages larger port cities and mayan ruins are a joy to explore though with as many locales as there are some of them do tend to blur together if anything ac4 is guilty of having too much too many locations too many collectibles too many forgettable villains to lengthen the story black flag 's chapters tend to focus in on a single side character per chapter some of them are fascinating some not so much i particularly enjoyed blackbeard stede bonnet and james kidd with kidd ranking as one of my favorites in the series so far your quartermaster adéwalé is a likeable and steady presence throughout the game but is hard pressed to match up when filling a similar role to leonardo da vinci from the ezio games there are a host of more shallow forgettable characters but this again isn 't new to the series there is still a modern side to the game too it is told in first person in such a way as to make you the player feel like you 're an abstergo employee this has never been the highlight of the series but it 's not so bad as to detract there is a neat tie -in to the pirate side of the story as well with it being an ongoing tale i did find myself straining to remember what had happened in past games newcomers to the series will struggle the most here but should be able to pick up the gist of it combat is also much the same here counterattacks are a powerful fallback if you get low on health while mashing the attack button stealth is the much more satisfying option thankfully the mix of jungle and city environments lend themselves well to it ship -to-ship battles place a plethora of weapons at your disposal from your standard cannons to mortars rams fire barrels and more there can be a lot to keep track of especially if you are up against more than one enemy at once and the sea is rough enough to obscure your view cannon smoke can also be a hindrance there are four awesome 'legendary' ships that you can hunt near end game each is a supreme challenge even with a fully upgraded warship by that point naval combat had gotten too easy for me but these four battles were a great finale to reinvigorate the system the sound and visuals in ac4 are up to par for a aaa title weather was something i noticed was better implemented than i 've seen in the series one standout was a barren rocky ruin along the ocean that had the constant howl of sea wind buffeting it the voice actors with a couple exceptions were great this is my least favorite soundtrack of the series so far i do have to commend it for the innovative use of sea shanties as an immersive and enjoyable backing to your sailing the dlc freedom cry 's soundtrack on the other hand is very good with a lot of african influence i 'll close with a few notes on dlc and the gold edition there is the 'aveline pack that is little more than a short 45 minute linear introduction to ac: liberation . it seem like it 's there more to promote liberation than be a strong product of its own freedom cry  is a solid 3 to 4 hour addition that has you playing as adéwalé after the events of black flag . it 's representation of slavery is a bit simplistic and pc but didn 't stop me from enjoying it with the gold edition not including the soundtrack freedom cry  is the only part with real value in my view so you 're probably better off getting the standard edition and picking up freedom cry  separately"
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'graphics']",the story sucks but the new pirate gameplay is just too good ! a new dawn of assassin 's creed franchise full of ships 9 /10 (exceptional) possibly the best pirate game of the current gen and one weird assassin 's creed setting ever but hey it works what 's great about this game is almost purely from its pirate element be a pirate captain upgrading your ship shooting ships and looting stuffs as ubisoft knows one weird good thing they made in ac iii was the ship battle system in term of gameplay it 's a very good action -adventure pirate game graphics may not be as good looking as their newer titles but the sea looks just fantastic also it should run pretty decent on any modern pcs now only downside of the game is its medicore storyline that hardly related to previous games although good news is you don 't have to play any of the those to play this it 's just another war between assassins and templars at caribbean sea
"['storyline', 'series']",where other men blindly follow the truth remember 'nothing is true 'where other men are limited by morality or law remember 'everything is permitted 'we work in the dark to serve the light we are assassins   assassin 's creed black flag mmm truly a masterpiece at its time being an assassin 's creed fan from the very start of the series i totally loved the ac 4 black flag everything about it the story characters naval battles everything the ending was very touching real beautiful and rich story you can 't miss this title it 's a must play   10 /10
"['assassin theme', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",this was my first assassin 's creed game amazing game the looks the gameplay all amazing highly recommend
"['series', 'assassin theme', 'character', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'music']",without a doubt this game is one of the best assassin 's creed games in the series amazing protagonist great naval gameplay loads to do beautiful and massive open world and last but not least sea shanties
"['pirate theme', 'series']",prolly the best ac ever released in this long licence serie its aquatic open world and interactive ship battles started as side activity in the previous episode but improved and centered around in this one is the strong point ever wanted to be a pirate there you are
"['series', 'exploration', 'pirate theme', 'combat', 'graphics', 'movement', 'music', 'storyline']",assassins creed black flag has got to be one of the best in the series this is my first ever assassin 's creed game and i really enjoyed my experience with it for the very first time it 's a very lengthy game with so much to do excluding the main missions there 's so many places to explore and the best part about the game is i can do pirate stuff and travel in the open sea world and literally go anywhere to any island i can even upgrade my ship upgrade suits weapons etc the caribbean landscape is beautiful and reminds me of the first time i played far cry 3 the weather system is done well if you 're not a fan of deep water sailing over huge waves during a storm can feel uneasy missions side missions tend to get repetitive e .g. tail this guy kill that guy and the save points when you fail can get frustrating i found the smaller things in game like pick pocketing random people quite fun you 'll find that after a while the shanties your crew sings will drive you insane to the point that you 're forced to go chase down notes in towns to vary things up though i enjoy the hand to hand combat i felt at times the system was a tad clunky whereas the computer seems to highlight enemies for you black flag is an excellent game in its own right but if you have played some of the other games then the first few hours at least will feel a little more awkward in comparison that said it has a much larger scope larger world than probably any of the batman games with entire secondary games (piracy naval combat and a unique historical context and engaging story line

"['series', 'storyline']",best assassin 's creed release with a lot of features and activities to do after finishing the main story not to mention your up -gradable ship
"['storyline', 'exploration']",pirates plunder oh my i finished the main storyline but there was a long way to go before getting everything completed this game it 's really well done and keeps you playing even if you 've finished the main story i still have a long way to go before synchronizing everything and collecting all secrets and treasures
"['assassin theme', 'exploration', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'optimization', 'frame rate']",by far the best experience i have ever had in an assasins creed game and arguably the best assasins creed purchase i have ever made i think they should focus more on adventure in their next game than the action leaves a much more appealing and lasting experience a must buy for any serious gamer just watch out for the settings though needs some high -end hardware to run it on ultra 60fps fhd
"['series', 'combat', 'exploration', 'storyline', 'graphics']",introduction so i 'm a huge fan of ac i play the franchise since the first one but i just start playing assassin 's creed iv black flag in the begginning of this year it 's that sad a lot but it 's never late to play a game that give an expirence so good to the players gameplay the gameplay it 's still like the old ac we aren 't in that full rpg age still but have already some mechanics implemented like per exemple the customization that isn 't really good but it 's like the other games of the franchise the map it 's huge we have so many places to explore in game and the best it 's that while you are playing the camapaign it 's impossible to don 't pass for some zones that you will stop and check if have some chest fragment etc the combat it 's pretty basic can be easily compared with his ancestors is basically the same with some different but this is more a question about the new enemies that make you need move more and don 't just attack the movimentation is one of the strong ac points like i said before you have so many places to explore and with that parkour you can literally explore everything in a funniest way that will not make you become bored with the game so easily now let 's enter what makes in my opinion assassin 's creed iv black flag a epic game forget everything that you saw about naval fights because this game focus so much in that it 's just amazing the mechanics are basic it 's just mouse 2 to aim mouse 1 to shoot etc basic like a said but it 's so unbelievable how can be cool and when you are fight against some strong enemy like a galion per exemple it 's just a no words sensation however if you pay attention you will see some stupid bugs of the game that aren 't soo cool what make the game lose a litle bit of quality story we play was edward kenway where you have already listen that name yes you are right this is the grandpa of our friend connor form ac iii but coming back to the edward story he is a pirate that just kills and steels a assassin that is traitor don 't know anything about the order blavlabla just readed a letter saying 'you will receive a lot of money and yes is a pirate and he goes etc i don 't wanna do a full spoiler about the game so play to know the rest or see youtube videos fun hell yeah this game it 's amazing i had soo much fun playing the naval fights are just the best the way that you control it 's ahhhhh i loved and after when you start attacking fortress and big boats like galions it 's just a epic expirence at least i had a lot of fun the camapaign isn 't also bad i preferred my old and good ac brotherhood but you can still have some good time playing this camapaign knowing that you will continue spending more time exploring the map conclusion it 's just one word to explain the game masterpiece the combat the map the movimentation being like the old ones isn 't bad for real its great and with that exploration of the naval fights makes this game become 100 a masterpiece still have some bugs and that it 's what makes not a 10 /10 for me
"['storyline', 'combat', 'stealth', 'movement', 'graphics', 'series']",with ac iv ubsisoft masters the art of mass appeal gaming in a spectacular open world unfortunately its game play is as shallow as its world is vast and its mechanics are pathetically anemic for an annualized franchise i 'm writing this review after having completd only about half of the main story because i 'm debating whether or not to continue after 20 or so hours the aspects of the game that were initally fun have beocme boring and repetive and its shortcoming are a constant source of frustration quite simply the game is no longer fun to play graphics quality is good the story is decent although it unfolds most through cut -scenes and linear missions combat is the same brain -dead block and parry nonsense that got old in the original assassins creed free run as glitchy as ever and quite often freely decides to move in a direction that defies all logic often resulting in a spectacular plummet from heights that took several minutes of diligent manuerving to achieve stealth is even more poorly implemented auto -stealth zones are a poor man 's stealth mechanic and ac iv continues to use them liberally the combination of simplsitic stealth and imprecise movement is a recipe for frustration many times i have been hangling from a ledge with a guard patrolling above waiting for the pricise moment to pounce when suddenly i jump up right in front of him no apparent reason triggering an alarm and failing the segment such fundamental flaws are unforgivable after a half dozen or so ac release iterations in all fairness resource gathering and crafting is greatly improved sea battles are the source of raw materials for upgrading your ship and upgrades are a neccesity to defeat stronger vessels but even then sailing around the world plays out like a single -player mmo enemy ships are everywhere so you must contantly engage in battle to get anywhere ship battles are fun for the most part but do get reptitive after sinking a couple hundred foes but grinding is required if you to obtain enough upgrades to take on legendary ships there are quite a few other activities as well like hunting and finding misc collecetibles and treasure but the appeal of those diversions eventually wears thin as well there are also a few out -of-animus experiences thrown for good measure they are so linear slow and dull then when given the chance of hacking a computer or jumping off a building i was dismayed to learn suicide was not actually an option which was unfortunate becuase the hacking mini -game made me want to kill myslef in real life so i 'm debating whether or not to continue my pirate adventure i 've actually put it away a couple times already then decided it deserved more of a chance i really want to like this game it presents a world full of potential unfortunatetly my voyages in ac iv seem to ultimately ground themelves on the rocks of shallow glitchy game play and missed opportunity so to save others the same frustrations it gets a thumbs down from me
"['series', 'combat', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'music', 'entertainment value']",black flag after the ezio trilogy is one of my favourite ac games the ship combat is just so much fun the carribean is a great setting i love pirates anyway and edward kenway is so much of an egotistical asshole that you just have to love him as a protagonist while gameplay wise black flag is probably the strongest title before origins it has one of the weakest main stories of the entire series as well as the most retarded 'community' collectables it does look absolutely beautiful on 4k even five years after release and sports a brilliant soundtrack (as well as several dozen historically accurate sea shanties which are just plain awesome anyone who likes pirates and the franchise definitely has to have played this and even for all other people out of those categories it is worth a look
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",even with all the cons i love this game this spirit of freedom drunkenness and pirates truly give away that atmosphere thanks for the game i went through it completely and am glad that i played this game assassin ’s creed iv black flag is best wich all assassin ’s
"['storyline', 'pirate theme']",by far the best assassin 's creed title to date at release fully -featured and stream -lined; nothing has been skimped on as a fan of sid meier 's pirates on the commodore 64 ac4 was a thrill to play black flag extends the seafaring experience of ac3 becoming the central focus only occasionally interrupted by assassinations which comprise of the usual ac fare my only real complaint there 's too much of it that being said i still played both expansions aveline and freedom cry the former a nice short adventure but by the time i finished the latter i was happy to be done skinnyfat lists 
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'combat']",a pirate that is an assassin killer that is a killer what could be better
['pirate theme'],boi if you are into pirates play this 'ω' 'ω'
"['storyline', 'exploration']",it 's a great ac game and a fun story but honestly the side content is the best part there 's a bunch of upgrades available tons of treasure to find and plunder forts to take over shipwrecks to scavenge and even go whaling for rare materials it doesn 't really add any new spice to the table on the ac side but it also doesn 't fail to deliver quality action so nothing to complain about there it would be nice to see more pirate games take notes from this game
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'series', 'graphics', 'customer support', 'uplay', 'full screen', 'entertainment value']","yeargh i had high expectations for this game after all the positive things i had heard about it though i know all too well that sometimes those things that alot of people think is great to me are far less so assassin 's creed 4 black flag is not one of those cases this game is awesome period it helps considerably that black flag shakes up the ac series which was in desperate need of something new and fresh ac2 and acb were awesome but acr added little new and ac3 seemed to have forgotten it was a game series that does killing better than managing a homestead about the only interesting thing ac3 did was add some naval missions which was a first for the series and ended up being the highlight of that game for me and it only got better in black flag as it had better considering this game centers around the 'golden age of piracy in the early 1700 's. a time when the spanish empire was still strong in the americas but the british were fast becoming dominant as well as usual you meet a fair number of historical figures here and this time it 's a more colorful cast for obvious reasons your main character edward kenway is a welsh pirate who in his desire for wealth and to support a family back home decides to venture to the caribbean to seek his fortune as far as ac protagonists go for me edward is a close second to ezio as being characters that i really like being much more interesting than his grandson connor from ac3 ever was story and characters are good here but it 's gameplay that makes this great black flag is in essence everything you could ever want in a pirate game lots of rum buried treasure fights and most of all sailing around in a huge open map able to attack and plunder as you please as far as sandbox games go there are two types the kind that have giant interesting open worlds that i can explore for hours without getting bored (fallout 3 skyrim most of the saints row games and others that end up leading me to just play the main missions because i see little reason to go exploring (oblivion, sleeping dogs some previous ac games black flag is the former i spent so much time just wandering about that i had to force myself to do story missions because i would otherwise never finish the game oh and one highlight worth mentioning money is actually useful in this game unlike past ac games where you used cash to do some management thing or improve your house you need mountains of cash to improve your ship which only encourages you further to roam the open world causing mayhem i hope future ac games take this approach because renovating shops or doing trade is at odds with the action gameplay and using the cash to further the gameplay you actually do is good this game isn 't perfect though the story missions are decent but too often involve tailing missions where you have to follow some tosser without being spotted a few are ok but they seem more common in this game than in past ac games and compared to the glory that is open world pirate action following some tosser through the streets of havana or kingston is completely uninteresting i also had a few bugs and one crash but this is hardly the most unstable game i 've ever played my new monster pc ran this game great on max settings but for others it may be a different story lastly i can do without the hunting and whaling stuff if only because i don 't like killing huggly animals except sharks fuck sharks also fuck uplay for simply existing and having achievements separate from steam ones anyways this game is awesome it might even be the best ac game i 've played it 's certainly comparable to ac2 and acb for those who saw the series stagnate after those games black flag is a sign that there is still life in this franchise and that maybe there are more great games to come from it we shall see :o yeargh"
"['character', 'storyline', 'assassin theme', 'series']",the protagonist edward kenway has some amazing character development and is a very interesting character since he is defined and built from his relationships with the people he has in his life the game itself plays well and never runs out of things to do which is almost overwhelming its a great assassins creed game let along game but for a pirate game it tops all others that i have seen i am one of the biggest fans of assassins creed saga and would recommend it to anybody who has even a slight interest in the assassins creed games

"['storyline', 'combat', 'pirate theme']",good story good gameplay but everybody just wants to remember the sly cooper pirate battles
['no topic'],still amazing even in the year of 2020
"['series', 'uplay']",the game itself is great easily the best ac game since ac 2 but since you have to use uplay it ruins the whole experiance if you can get uplay to even run you 'll see yourself playing many hours of black flag only for uplay to erase all of your progress because of uplay i cannot recomend this game at all or any ubisoft game

"['uplay', 'series']","[to be read in a calm voice this is my first review of the game that i didn 't play (till now so why am i writing this because uplay don 't get me wrong ac4 is probably great that 's why i bought it but it needs uplay and here problem begins i neither need it nor want it no matter what it offers and whats more important i simply don 't believe it works and now i have one more reason for it after you download about 30gb it needs to connect you can 't immediately play in offline mode when uplay doesn 't work you are screwed if there is a server maintenance overload ddos or just anything wrong you are screwed today uplay doesn 't work for me (trust me i tried all the usual stuff as reinstall and so on and i know it 's not steams fault and all that is because a thing i don 't like i don 't want and i don 't use it 's my fault i broke my own rule for a long time i don 't buy games that requires 3rd party stuff i never had use for them didn 't create even more accounts avatars or profiles and i never will also i 'm an old fart so i remember those days when if you bought a game it wasn 't 'right to use it for period of time on specific service it was actually _yours_ thats why i love gog and indie developers so much steam is a different story but it 's a sevice that i chose to use also i honestly think it tries to improve itself and i get the feeling valve loves gamers do not treat them like enemies that must be punished in advance because 'pirates'. do i recommend this game of course i won 't hate it just for what happened to me but in order to help you with your decision all i can say is 'please, take a few seconds and think about what and who do you support next time i will breaking of own rules is stupid anyway"
['pirate theme'],greatest pirate game ever
"['graphics', 'combat', 'entertainment value']",by far the best assassin 's creed game it has good graphics good gameplay and amazing environment i really recommend you to play this game
"['storyline', 'combat', 'series', 'pirate theme']",although i was largely dissapointed by ac3 ac4 thankfully was not the same although the combat is largely similar and some of the missions are repetitive the story is engaging and the pirate gameplay is fantastic
"['assassin theme', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'series', 'combat', 'uplay']",its been a while since i completed this looking at it today i realised i hadn 't wrote a review so here goes black flag is definitely my favourite assassins creed title to date (i haven 't played rogue or unity so i can 't comment on them the different combinations of side quests and missions kept me interested through most of the story it is strange to think how long it has taken for there to finally be a great pirate game and i really do emphasise on the word great sea exploration battles and challenges are a wonderful addition to what i considered a pretty flat series assassins creed looked destined to drag out the series with pretty much the same -as-normal routines that you would expect in most of ubisofts titles but black flag truly surprised me i was immediately drawn to it when i first heard the inclusion of ships battle in fact this reminded me of when total war finally brought naval battles into the game i would spend hours enjoying it just like black flag it brought all those great memories back very refreshing and nice to be able to come back to (first had this on ps4 i 'm looking forward to getting round to playing rogue and unity to see if ubisoft has been able to keep up with this excellent title ps as a side note uplay is horrendous (as we all know many times the game did crash or uplay decided to notplay it definitely became frustrating but overall didn 't dampen my black flag experience too much
"['pirate theme', 'series']",great pirate game forgot it was ac

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'music']",yo ho ho and a bottle of rum this sums up my time in the game story the story is a wild amalgamation of all sorts of pirate -era perks in the caribbean the player takes control of an aspiring pirate and follows him on the road to glory for several years at some point magic typical of assasins creed comes into play and everything gets a bit swashbuckly i 'm not into the whole mythos behind the assasins creed series and the brief interludes in 'reality' feel forced and unfamiliar for me the game would work as a pure pirate game the protagonists and antagonists are great and it 's just a great adventure for long stretches what i don 't like about the story is that the main character never really becomes an assassin he steals the equipment and with it apparently the skills while i didn 't understand in part 3 why the main character moves like an assassin even before training it 's even less clear to me here with edzio (part 2 and altaïr (part 1 the training part was much more clearly told in part 4 the almost superhuman abilities of an assassin simply fall into the main character 's lap and there is no character progression in that direction gameplay the gameplay remains at the usual level the open world has been made smoother it happened to me much less often that i suddenly plunged into the abyss and when i did the fall damage outside of missions was reduced so much that there was hardly any frustration the battles are also better staged now and the enemies no longer stand around in circles waiting to be slaughtered one after the other you regularly get hit in the back just when you want to finish someone off with a finisher but there could be a bit more variety in the fighting i could only roughly identify three types of enemies all of which are not very different from each other the ship 's controls and the battles on the high seas are a real treat they become a bit redundant at some point but they are the real strength of the game like a real sailor i was always looking forward to going to sea again the open world offers many possibilities but i didn 't take advantage of many of them and therefore can 't report much you can dive for treasures dig for treasures hunt land animals and whales collect inca treasures collect songs take on missions for the assasins and so on you can attack forts and take control of sea areas here it would have been great if you had to defend a fort from time to time and the war over the caribbean waved back and forth the game has a small mini -game in which you can send your fleet on missions every day i played it three or four times and then lost interest that was at the time when every game came with a companion app so that you could still be in the game even when you weren 't actually playing it 's purely optional the app hasn 't been supported for a long time and it feels like a foreign body in a single -player game it was a terrible trend graphic the game is a feast for the eyes it is now seven years old and has survived this time very well of course it can 't compete with current titles but nothing about the graphics bothered me the water and the spray that keeps rolling over the deck of the ship are particularly noteworthy i could watch for hours minutes no one has time to watch hours of digital water rolling over a deck it was nice sound the sound of the game is what convinced me technically in the thick of battle shouts screams and other noises come at you from everywhere the individual island cities hum with life the orchestral music pushes you into the sea battles and in the quiet moments the crew sings sea shanties while the bow breaks the waves the game has the right soundscape for every atmosphere conclusion i have played all the games in the series up to part 4 so far part 4 is the most advanced part of the series in terms of gameplay all the activities i had to do from the game were fun optional grinds i skipped without missing anything the story and character are not as great as part 2 with edzio auditore but much better than part 3 or 1 because of the great pirate theme if part 2 is too outdated for you i can only recommend part 4

"['series', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'graphics', 'movement']","black flag is going to be the last assassin 's creed i buy and i 've liked the series since the original (yeah, i actually like that game why you ask i mean after all i 've played more than 50 hours of this game i clearly didn 't hate it there 's a lot to like here the pirating is fun especially because there 's been barely any good pirate games ever since the remake of sid meier 's pirates and that was ten years ago edward kenway is a likable protagonist that doesn 't give a crap about ancient aliens brought to you by the history channel he just wants the british and spanish to donate to his retirement fund by giving him all their sugar and rum it 's also a atmospheric game with some nice exploration finding everything will definitely keep you busy the thing is though is that the game is still plagued with frustrations that while they don 't straight up ruin the game prevent it from becoming truly great this mainly comes through the old assassin 's creed gameplay of platforming and combat black flag is jank as hell when it comes to platforming assassin 's creed always had a bit of clunky platforming at times but this is noticeably worse coming off of shadow of mordor proves this to me even more mordor was utterly smooth while in black flag it wasn 't uncommon for the controls to sh *t themselves causing me to plunge to my death the combat is also worse than the ezio trilogy due to the sh *tty camera which was way too zoomed in which allows enemies to cheap shot you off screen enemies also have too good priority being able to see you and hit you before you react sometimes the future plot is at an absolute nadir here with an obnoxious metaplot that ’s far more annoying than desmond ’s stuff ever was and i always thought he was the worst part of the series (though i never played 3 all this goes to show that assassin 's creed really isn ’t improving and i assume 3 has ruined the series from here on out but ultimately do i recommend this game yes i do despite all the problems it ’s a solid sendoff for the series seeing is that unity and rogue clearly aren ’t helping to prevent the series downward spiral it ’s definitely worth your time if you ’ve liked the series up till this point and /or want a new pirate game"

"['pirate theme', 'exploration', 'assassin theme']",i highly recommend playing ac black flag it 's one of the best entries the assassins creed franchise has to offer what makes it so enjoyable and worthy of your time is the fact that it catches the pirate feeling right from boarding ships and capturing fortresses in enviorenment occuppied by england and spain to exploring such variety of islands which have unique things to offer i assure you that you will entertain yourself in this 60 hour journey while being both a pirate and an assassin
['entertainment value'],i love it <3
"['pirate theme', 'exploration', 'combat', 'series', 'movement', 'music']",i was never into the assassin 's creed series i didn 't 'get' the break out to the modern segments i just want to play the stinkin game but i 've been looking for a good pirate game and this one succeeds in spades where so many others fail i want the visceral fun of naval battles boarding parties sword fights etc but without all the fiddly bits that take away the fun the ac design adds various levels to explore collect money and resources craft all in a fairly open sand box when i exhaust an area its time to explore the main story mission and see where that takes me or just play the missions and ignore all of that (not my preference its up to the player the pacing is good most cut scenes can be skipped (but many can 't and that 's annoying but i guess those are important and the game trains you in -game on each new piece of functionality until you realize how many tools you actually have in your tool kit all of them give you control but have enough ai built in to make it fun it is challenging but not frustrating to advance (so far i haven 't finished i haven 't yet found a timed mission i can 't possibly complete (like most games causing me to quit the game climbing over roof tops running along clothes lines jumping from roof to roof swinging from ship to ship snagging and subduing a baddie from a hay bale dynamic non -repetitive combo attacks in a sword fight with heart pumping music all seamlessly pulls you into the game i hope ubisoft pulls the pirate out of the ac and develops its own game genre in the future
['pirate theme'],buy only for the sea shanties if nothing else
['no topic'],if you wanna know how to find the cd key go to your steam library and go to blackflag and press the setting icon and go to manage than you see a cd key option
"['storyline', 'graphics']",brilliant game definitely a changing point for the series however it should be noted that sometimes your ship will disappear however this is easily fixed by rebooting the game fantastic scenery and textures
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",loved the story it was more pirates game than assassin but i think that 's fine the story is a bit sad takes a character that at first glance seems utterly unlikeable and through his struggles and tragedies you end up loving him best assassin 's game i 've played
['series'],best game ac 10 /10
"['optimization', 'graphics']","campaign 9 /10 graphics 9 /10 fun rate 10 /10 possibilities 10 /10 amazing game maybe bad optimized but with my 1060 i can actually run the game maxed settings (physx,vsync off in 60 -61 fps"
"['storyline', 'assassin theme', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']","this game has one of the best story -lines and without a doubt one of the best assassin 's creed game game -play wise the story is amazing takes unexpected turns quite sad at times and unpredictable the ending can bring tears to your eyes the protagonist edward kenway has great personality though not an assassin at first there 's nothing unlikable about him hunting fishing pirating and buying stuff to upgrade your gear and your ship over time really feels like quite an accomplishment the combat is fast -paced hack and slash third person swordplay combined with several guns is simply amazing the naval combat is an awesome and a completely new experience to the assassin 's creed series (yes, the previous game had a similar thing but with a lot of scripted game -play). every unique ship battle is an unforgettable experience in this game the voice actors have done an awesome job as well giving every character in the game an unique personality there are insane amount of collectibles available in this game but they do give promising rewards there are several outfits available in shops for you to try out from time to time and also a lot of weapons different kinds of guns many customization for your ship 's different parts etc while there 's no difficulty setting available in this game you do have the option to not upgrade your maximum health and your ship 's health to get a challenge a lot of the islands are almost identical and major locations also seem to have same textures which can feel boring at times the negative things are online events you need to complete several online events in order to reach 100 synchronization there are online missions that offer you a lot of customization rewards but that requires you to be online and it progresses in real -time. if you don 't have any friends on uplay that own the game and is willing to 'speed up your progress then your chances of getting all those rewards and completing the game to 100 would become very low overall it 's really great i would recommend anyone to buy it"
"['errors', 'uplay']",great game but after ubisoft connect was introduced it no longer runs just crashes at the start of the first story cutscene and of course according to ubisoft support this is entirely my fault because there is absolutely no way ubisoft can be wrong is there edit i fixed the issue seems that turning off anti aliasing worked this never happened before so i don 't know what has been done with the game
"['series', 'uplay']",i actually loved this game when i played it a while ago on ps4 but i wasn 't playing it on a pc uplay is absolute trash and i shouldn 't have to rely on being able to connect to ubisoft 's god -awful servers just to play a game i bought f *ck uplay and f *ck ubisoft
"['pirate theme', 'shanties']",leave her johnny leave her tomorrow ye will get your pay and it 's time for us to leave her  for those of you who don 't know the 'her' being left is not a woman but the ship this shanty was traditionally sung when the ship was at port after it had docked in the final spell at the pumps
"['pirate theme', 'music']",i came for the assassins but stayed for the shanties seriously those shanties grand theft high seas with shanty fm this is the only ac game i ever go back and repeatedly re -install and play through ...because i missed the shanties
"['series', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'combat', 'optimization', 'movement']",love the game it is the first ac game in the series that i play and i love everything about it the graphics are amazing the story is catchy there is a lot to explore and the naval battles are just amazing positive aspects i really started to like the present day missions the computer hacking and stuff however i foresee a grimm ending (please don 't spoil it for me i like the fact that the resources (metal mostly are kind of scarce and you either get them from naval battles wreckages or warehouses the world is huge some negative aspects tail and evesdrop missions are kind of repetitive and while you get the hang of it i would much prefer to do different stuff some unrealistic fort takeovers super tornadoes while attacking it and after you capture it it 's sunny all of a sudden (like... come on update good god i played like 55 hours without ever using mortar just accidentally found out how to use it update 2 just finished the game didn 't like the ending that much maybe i 'll try to defeat all the 4 legendary ships (actually just 3 left and collect all the animus fragments and to get 100 sync and also i should play freedom cry overall a great game imo
['no topic'],great game it is the third time i am playing it and it is fascinating as always nostalgic too
"['storyline', 'character', 'combat', 'series', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",this has got to easily be my favourite assassin 's creed of all time and oddly enough it 's my first time ever playing it in 2020 i actually avoided it when it first came out because i could care less about pirates the clunky naval combat brought back from aciii and of course due to my overall loss of interest in the series with the way aciii ended continuing with my assassin 's creed series marathon this year getting to play black flag for the first time ever i was instantly pleased with how much they did right with this game whenever i play it i can feel the love and attention the developers gave this one a kind of love and attention not all ac games have gotten at least as far as i can tell right away i felt like i was going to be embarking on a very grand adventure with one of the most endearing protagonists in the series edward isn 't even an actual assassin merely a pirate stole the robes of an assassin to impersonate them in the attempt to score a buttload of booty he may be selfish and his only goal may be getting rich but there 's an earnestness to him because he wants to earn more to provide a better life for his wife then not to mention his relationship to his crew mates most notably adewale and james kidd just really bring out the best in him showing that he 's more than just a greedy pirate he 's a greedy pirate with heart much like aciii this game is very good to play without the hud as mission marks show up as icons in the world that you can follow but very unlike aciii the main missions are actually fun in this one aciii had some of the worst and most unengaging main missions and the only thing that kept me going through the tedium of lame missions --like following directions on horseback from paul revere or commanding american troops when to shoot at british redcoats --was the incredible story and side missions aciii had to offer it 's like they tried too hard to deviate from the tried and tested formula but failed miserably aciv black flag on the other hand continues to deviate from the tried and tested ac formula while also respecting it and including it at first i didn 't like the idea of focusing a lot more on naval combat as i hate vehicular combat in video games most notably naval combat in all assassin 's creed games but thankfully for the one centered around pirates it is actually a whole lot of fun to do them here top it all off with classic ac gameplay like infiltrating big places with a ton of places to hide and stab guys from this is easily the best ac game that tried to do something different but actually succeeded while staying true to the series roots the sheer amount of things you can do in this game is unbelievable where most open world games bore me with checklists of side content to stretch out my play time i feel like with this one in particular it 's from genuine fun and enjoyment where i 'll be taking my time with this game the main story is definitely awesome but i don 't want to rush it as i feel so immersed and engrossed by this game 's story atmosphere and overall experience this is a definite recommendation from me i give it an 11 /10. can 't believe i already have 20 hours under a week and i 'm nowhere near the end of the story as far as i can tell but that just speaks volumes of how lost i am in this game 's world
"['series', 'graphics', 'music', 'combat', 'storyline', 'difficulty']",probably the best ac series i have ever played i still need to play the others and this was my first ever ac i played there 's also a book of this as well (still need to read it the good ~awesome graphics ~music is like from the orchestra ~open world ship battles ~pirates ~decent combat movements the bad ~short story ~needs 3rd party software ~combats are way too easy 8 .8/10 i 'll have to play the others also if you love the pirates of the caribbean movies then you will love this
"['movement', 'combat', 'ship gameplay', 'story']",i in turn love this game and ill explain why parkour the parkour of assassins creed 4 is similar to the outdoor free running of ac3 but with some great changes first you don 't just randomly start climbing a wall when running it feels very smooth and clean but a notorious run up a wall and jump off that is terrible combat the combat is relatively easy unless you come across an officer or heavy soldiers these special soldiers can parry and counter attack the two swords make the fighting very interesting with some bad ass animations the pistols are slightly unrealistic because when you reload it does the normal reloading animation then does the same animation 2 -4 times depending on how many pistols you carry the pistols have great variety and are made for every players needs combat extended one of the weapons you come across is the blow gun it can shoot 2 profectiles a sleep dart (knocks them out for a period of time and a beserk dart (it makes the victim start attacking others you also have an array of odd weapons such as the throwing knife (self explanatory and the rope dart the rope dart can be used to hang or pull soldiers to you i didnt use these much but when i did they were extremely useful you also have two hidden blades gadgets some of the gadgets or items you get include the smoke bomb and money the smoke bomb stun and blind soldiers whilst the gold draws civilians with means you can blend in ship gameplay the ship gameplay is acclaimed and overall extremely fun and diverse the weapons you have include the mortar (a long range upward firing cannon that shoots a shell that explodes over the target spewing it with cannon balls the chain shots (used to fire at sails and slow ships round shot (normal cannon shot heavy shot (a flaming cannonball of close ranged death and the swivels (after you make a solid hit against the the solid part of the ship it leaves weakpoints that the swivels fire at dealing massive damage after you decapicate a ship you can board it and have to kill crew and /or cut a flag and /or kill a captain and scouts after doing this you can repair your ship the jackdaw or send it to your fleet you can also lower your wanted level (if your wanted level is high enough pirate hunters come after you there is also assassin contracts which involve killing a target bonus for remaining stealth naval contracts which you hunt down ships you can also save pirates and unlock taverns story the story is brilliant there is character development is solid as titanium and the story in general is simply brilliant nope no spoilers in conclusion this game is the best in the franchise
['pirate theme'],do what you want 'cause a pirate is free you are a pirate
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'difficulty', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']","a merry life and a short one  summary  assassin 's creed 4 is the last assassin 's creed i played and the best one that i 've played in my opinion which is funny since the least 'assassin's creed -esque' game in the series in black flag you play as edward kenway a ship -wrecked pirate who finds himself in the role of an assassin after his initial ship is attacked as you progress through the game you 'll be given your own ship 'the jackdaw which you can upgrade with materials you salvage from ships you attack and warehouses you raid in my opinion the naval combat and ship customization /upgrade system in this game is it 's strongest aspect providing a rewarding and satisfying sense of accomplishment as you get enough materials to complete that one upgrade you need to tackle a particularly strong foe while the game was able to hold my attention and keep me entertained for the entirety of the story the grind for 100 is very tedious making you venture out to random little islands in the world to break open one chest at a time still this doesn 't detract from the overall experience and it 's still fun to hop back in every now and then to be the menace of the seven seas  pros  large dynamic open -world to explore and make your own side activities are mostly fun and rewarding (i.e. fort takeovers revealing locations on the map and making the seas safer assassination contracts providing reales which you can use to purchase better gear and templar hunts and mayan treasure hunts which provide unique armor sets rewards for 100 completion hunting and crafting system (can also buy materials if you can 't be bothered to hunt parkour and movement is still as fun as ever interesting historical story  cons  i still haven 't 100 %ed this game because collecting all the little chests and manuscripts gets so boring and menial no real emphasis on stealth outside of some story missions you can gun through the entire game and be fine less of an 'assassin's creed game and more of a 'pirates of the caribbean game which isn 't necessarily a bad thing combat feels too easy you can just mash the counter button and win every fight you get into  rating 8 /10, great   bonus quote 'uhhh... please to repeat 'oh, for f **k's sake "
"['storyline', 'character', 'graphics', 'music', 'combat', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",with the end of the world plot and demond miles story being wrapped up in ac3 assassin 's creed iv had the freedom to explore and chart new waters and it really does show in this grand adventure ubisoft have shown that the assassin 's series is far from running out of ideas as this installment for me is easily the most enjoyable and rewarding of them all edward kenway a man who is still uncertain of just what kind of man he is takes up life on the sea in hope to one day be able to live a comfortable and easy life his ambitions extend to as far as a coin can shimmer and no further this story isn 't one about conspiracy theories or attempts to save the world it 's a personal story of identity purpose and self realisation that many including myself can very much relate to what truly matters to a man and a woman the characrers are easily what make this game so memorable each rough pirate and posh kingsman brings with them an equally vast and rich personality that you 'll either love to love or love to hate the voice acting is absolutely incredible and some scenes hold some truly gripping speeches managing to play this on ultra the game is gorgeous when you first take control of edward and you sea the deep blue of the ocean the lush green vegetation and the warm glow of the sands it 's hard to not take a minute and just observe everything around you even free running and chase segments in the jungle i found myself just admiring the level desging so much the music is yet another immersive feature to this game that a great deal of attention has been obviously applied to the tavern music brings life to the towns you visit and the shanties sang as you explore the west indies makes you feel you 're on an adventure for riches i think the biggest attraction gameplay wise for most people has to be the naval combat i personally love pirate games already and found the combat to be fast intense and very enjoyable the moment you incap a ship and call your crew to ready to board never gets old there is enough freedom for you to play as you want either defensively with fire barrels up close with heavy shot or snipe them with mortar fire as with other creed games black flag has a a lot of other activities to take part in optional lands and towns to explore and mysteries to uncover if you have an eye for adventure you 'll feel right at home on the jackdaw my only problem is that the game is still restricted to the idea you 're reliving memories and as such the 'animus' prevents you from going to certain places at certain times becase 'it wasn 't available in this sequence or it 'd take you out of the experience of the 1700 's to run around in a modern day office doing chores for people you don 't know and don 't bother questioning why while ubisoft did do a good job in limiting both those things to a minimum it was still something that didn 't need to be there and restricted the experience for me at least black flag is a very rich game in character content and reasons to play if you want to get lost in the oceans and adventure or be a part of a grand story with grander characters then be sure to pick this gem up

"['graphics', 'character', 'series', 'storyline', 'difficulty']",nice graphics nice world beautiful nvidia physics nice main character but ezio more charismatic and better but this game have old problems with gameplay and the same type boring missions conclusion much much better than assassin 's creed 3 but i love assassin 's creed 2 more ezio auditore da firenze forever my score 86 /100 (must have в игре хорошая графика качественные текстуры отменный динамичный дым благодаря физиксу прикольный главный герой но по харизме не дотягивает до эцио вместе с тем в игре присутствуют и недостатки так и не доработали геймплей с 1 части асасина не дотягивают французы в этом плане до бэтмана скучные однотипные миссии типа выследи врага подслушай разговор защити от врагов которые появляются на крышах из воздуха (ассасины в одной из первых миссий и т .д. морские баталии и хорошая графика тащат игру однозначно лучше провальной третей части но на мой взгляд ac2 по -прежнему лучшая часть в серии

"['no topic', 'customer support', 'uplay']",do .not.buy under any circumstance   i made that mistake the game 's servers are unavailable denying people to activate their cd -key. which means this game is a scam i searched ubisoft forums and people have this issue for over a year where they can 't access their in -game content or simply activate the game 1 year and ubitrash can 't or don 't want to solve this issue giving fake workaround answers to pissed off users for those of us who just bought it and can 't activate the key we have 3 options refund it pray that the next ubisoft connect update will solve this problem because apparently this problem occured before when ubisoft connect updated simply pirate the game from a torrent site (ironic isn 't it my guess is that they simply shutted down the servers but never actually stopped selling the game cuz money is money right so the support are being given instructions to bamboozle users that the issue is being investigated and worked on because i contacted the support and they gave me the same vague explanation as they were giving people for 1 year till now now i only wonder which is the worst company between ubisoft and ea ea did real 'crimes' against gaming but with the proper backlash from communities they eventually do something ubisoft on the other hand just simply doesn 't give a flying s *it about its communities or players indifference is worse than a simply bad product i just hope one day someone with a lot of money and time will try and sue those companies for stuff like that so they start treating the players right instead of looking at them as a breathing walking wallets also i would appreciate anybody who encountered problems like this to give the game a negative review so the problem becomes obvious even tho they will ignore it again probably it 's sad cuz the game is good if the issue is solved i will edit this but i doubt it it 's ubisoft edit it still has some server issues but at least you can register the game and play also since it provides all dlc 's i can 't see my 'freedom cry dlc in the game not letting me play or at least i can 't see it either way i am swtiching too a thumbs up primerly for the game but ubisoft are still trash
"['pirate theme', 'series']",this game is by far the funnest pirate game i 've played let alone the ac title for it it could be a stand alone pirate game and still be amazing the way you set sail with your crew putting the fear of god into anyone at sea to cross your path taking down my first man o war i freaking jumped out of my chair i fought that bitch for 10 minutes (not super upgraded with jackdaw -your ship at the time i mean what 's not to love okay maybe you don 't get other ships however i like the idea of having one ship as you build it up fight big ass ships with it dive from the very top a few times or jumping from your ship to board an enemy ship you come to feel like your ship can 't be replaced i mean i get it it 's a game you want bigger and better pros -you're a pirate -you own an island -pushing your crew out of your boat when you try to board the enemy ship -blowing the hell out of naval fortresses -taking over that same fortress -shark/whale harpooning at sea cons -you're not a pirate in real life
"['storyline', 'character', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",i couldn ’t get into the assassin creed games the illusion of choice masking linear gameplay and limited options too much running around hiding waiting out pursuit timers easily obtainable goals climbing towers and shifting storylines that killed my suspension of disbelief but i kept buying them cause the attention to detail was astonishing the user -interfaces were so well thought out the tutorials were thoughtful the fighting was pretty fun the characters interactions with the world reminded me of the prince of persia games the historical touches were engaging and the voice acting was excellent but i didn ’t play them more than a few hours cause i got bored so “black flag went on sale i scooped it up cause my brother said it was decent but i let it sit for months cause i thought it would be more of the same i have to give ubisoft some props this game is more expansive there ’s more freedom more sense of accomplishment and i ’m just having a good time it ’s polished like all the other games but some of the island scenes are just knock -out beautiful it ’s transportive i ’m loving the sense of exploration the pirate songs the layers this game is an incredible accomplishment and i ’m glad a gave the franchise another chance well worth a look for any action adventure or even rpg fan like me
"['graphics', 'storyline', 'music', 'entertainment value']",extremely wonderful gameplay graphics with great story telling amazing music as well everything about this game screams fantasy with amazing movie level music and graphics i would recommend this game as a fun de -stressing game where you play it on your off time and enjoy the story
"['series', 'assassin theme']",started playing this back in the days on my ps3 had alot of fun then i stopped playing but bought it on pc and its still one of the best assassin 's game ever it 's a must have

"['storyline', 'combat', 'optimization', 'uplay', 'graphics', 'customer support', 'cloud mechanics', 'full screen']","out of all the assassins creed games this is still my favorite the game just fits with the pirate story perfectly there is a good balance of story combat and collectibles the story is interesting and fun to play unlike ac3 most of the optional objectives are actually doable though some are a case of 'what do you mean air tackle but after some looking up its again doable this is one of the few games that i have 100 completion there are only a few things that are not so good most of them are ubisoft dumbness one such issue is they disabled cloud saves if you want to secure you progress be sure to backup the 'savegame' folder in the ubisoft launcher programs folder another such dumbness is that for whatever reason the game will not get to the main menu if the game is installed to a windows storage space another is the game is incapable of going above 60 fps also you may have to go into the steam controller configuration and use it as a compatibility layer the game seams to not work correctly with xbox one controllers but does with the 360 controller that steam emulates my last grievance is that during ship boarding the rope swings and very spotty in reliability the land you in the water over the ship into the wall ,glitched into the sails and so on its rare when i actually get on the ship even more rare to land on someone"
"['pirate theme', 'storyline']",this is by far the best assassins creed game i used to play 'sid meier 's pirates from 2004 back then it was the best pirate game ever made black flag is basicly the same game but with updated graphic and a new story the best thing about this game is that most of the stories are based on true events that actually happened back then this is like 'playing a history book i recommend this game to all pirate lovers who like hours and hours of fun 10 /10 points
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",probably one of the best ac games ever made

"['storyline', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",black flag learns from ac 3 ’s initial 10 hours of banal hand -holding by immediately throwing you into the action after a lean and exhilarating opening mission that places you in the blood -soaked boots of connor ’s much livelier and more likeable grandfather edward kenway the world blossoms and allows you to explore its vast uncharted waters the size of the world is staggering and the fact that it 's absolutely brimming with fun and rewarding activities made me want to get lost as possible as i traveled from point a to point b
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",how far can you stray from home before it 's impossible to ever return that 's the question at the heart of assassin 's creed iv black flag it 's something that plagues edward kenway the game 's roguish hero as he explores the caribbean in search of wealth and the dream of returning to england a more respectable man but for as much as kenway longs for the day he can leave the pirate life behind the freedom of the open sea is a difficult thing to resist and who can blame him because after this stunning and beautifully realized tale of adventure on the high seas it 's hard to imagine the assassin 's creed series returning to its landlocked roots the world of black flag is nothing short of remarkable this is the most expansive setting in the history of the franchise a virtual rendition of the west indies that encompasses all manner of burgeoning colonies mayan ruins and deadly jungles cities like havana and nassau reflect the series trademark attention to detail from the stonework cathedrals of the former to the ramshackle taverns of the latter then there are the remote islands inhabited by nothing more than crabs and sea turtles underwater shipwrecks waiting to be explored and vast stretches of sparkling caribbean waters that are every bit as deadly as they are gorgeous indeed what makes black flag so special is the way it captures the thrill of sailing the open sea it 's more than the spectacle of a humpback whale leaping into the air and spraying the deck of your ship or the sound of your crew breaking out into a sea shanty just as the sun is beginning to set across the horizon it 's the feeling that there 's always something out there to be discovered rewards waiting to be captured no matter who 's standing in your way 8 .5/10

"['pirate theme', 'movement']",movement can be wonky at times but the core gameplay /vibe of being a pirate is incredibly fun been one of my favorite games ever since it came out still often get on and just cruise around on my ship
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme']","one of the best assassin 's creed game on market still totay this amazes me how good it is made best pirate game ever 8 ,7/10 recommended"
['no topic'],this game made me jump out of my window onto the roof except i landed in the street
"['uplay', 'errors']",bought the gold edition and when activating the game on ubiconnect it shows as standard version no dlcs despite steam saying it 's gold edition refunded because of that
['series'],one of the best games in the series
"['graphics', 'difficulty', 'story', 'errors']",graphics 8 /10  difficulty 7 /10  game time 12h story 9 /10  bugs a few finally 8 .5/10
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",if you love pirates and have have played asssassin 's creed before than i really recomend this game
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'character', 'entertainment value']",i feel like i should say something about this game since i was very sceptical at the beginning and was ignoring the whole assassin 's creed series for years honestly i can now easily assort this as one of my biggest errors i have ever done (i have 't played any previous ac games assassin 's creed iv black flag game first of all i should point out that it is very intelligent game with complex and thrilling story and interesting characters smart dialogues and amazing scenes the whole game is based on the historical facts so it 's educative as hell too the open world in this game is realistic and fun graphics and the game 's design is perfect i like the balance between the main story and side missions the game gives you as much space as you want in the way how you want to proceed the game 's soundtrack is brilliant and feelingful aswell as the voice over which makes an irreplaceable atmosphere in this game the main characters pirates are unique and definitely not boring you will find nothing like wooden leg parrots or eyepatch here they are really well written characters i would recommend black flag to anyone who likes action adventure games and ignored ac series even to those who hate pirates because this game illustrates them just the way they should be i know it 's still very romantic kind of way to look on them but what the hell 10 /10
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",assassin 's creed maybe pirates of the caribbean welsh edition 100 couldn 't do all the objectives cuz i closed the game near the end of the credits and don 't want to sit through them again great game tho
['no topic'],there is going to be an epidemic in the coming years of people wanting to replay old (er) games and routinely being locked out of whatever useless 3rd -party launcher was shoved down their throat by the wannabe monopoly that originally exploited the devs who actually produced the game i intend to steal every ubisoft game moving forward and you should too
"['storyline', 'series']",best assassins creed game that ever existed
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'series', 'optimization', 'graphics']",unlike its predecessors titles ac black flag is a much more fast -paced assassin 's creed it brought an unique theme and they improved the naval battles that we get to know in ac 3 making it much more explorable if you like pirate things you will love it it 's a 'let's go have some fun title with a massive open -world. the puzzles the series used to have are kind gone but it still have some interisting things to get to know for the ones who like the misterious part of the series those who don 't like the gap ac is well known to make with modern day will like this title because there 's little worth to mention how they wrapped up the kenway 's family story tied to the ac 3 it was made in a much more susteined finale than ac 3 well optimized nowadays so i 'd recommend you give it a shot if its your first time playing the series its well paired to the others but with a completely different atmosphere you are much more in the sea than on earth to close it out not the best ac title but a enjoyable game while it lasted
['pirate theme'],i guess you could say this game was pirated 10 /10 would play again i hate my life
"['storyline', 'entertainment value']",great fucking game great story
"['assassin theme', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'exploration']",this is my first time to play an assassin 's creed game i picked this one since everyone says it 's one of the best ac games i can 't say much but so far i love this game the environment looks so beautiful and the story is interesting the protagonist kicks some a and i get to drive a ship fantastic
['uplay'],don't buy this game on steam the cd key from steam can't be activated by ubisoft connect i suggest you can buy it directly at the ubisoft store
"['series', 'gameplay', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",in my opinion the best assassin 's creed game never played the last games of this series but played all before this one and black flag is the best game of the series awesome gameplay story sound visuals and good performance didnt get tired of the game or tryed to rush to end it
['customer support'],good game but ubisoft deleting inactive accounts is scum i pay for a game i expect to keep that game
['no topic'],lots to do before your satisfied even after you 're done the game great pickup
"['uplay', 'errors']",can 't play without activating the game on uplay uplay servers have been down for 4 hours now and i 'm unable to activate the game and play it
['pirate theme'],why are pirates called pirates because they arrr
"['graphics', 'storyline', 'optimization', 'uplay', 'combat', 'series', 'movement']",9 /10 fantastic presentation some breathtaking sceneries especially at sea graphics in tropical places are always more impressive interesting story different from the previous games in the series likable main character (although a pirate meaning greedy open world game with tons of things to do (ubisoft seems to have mastered the open world gameplay mechanics that 's why i 'm sure watch dogs is gonna be the best game of the year i really liked the dispay of statistics by pressing the middle mouse button it gives you a sense of completion my worry in ac games always was that i didn 't do everything i could now you can track this much easier i also liked the chance to rate each mission after it ends multiplayer looks nice although i don 't really care in this kind of game for mp it seems this time ati cards are better optimised since it runs identically in both my nvidia and ati pc they have to improve fighting it looks impressive but it doesn 't feel like it when actually playing they have to make it less automatic counter is all you have to do to kill enemies easily or sometimes break their guard but it needs more than that i don 't have to play more to review the game i know it 's (after ac2 my favorite ac game endless opportunities for this franchise i hope ubisoft will make the best out of it
['no topic'],do not buy this game nor dlcs ubisoft screwed big time and now plans to shut down servers of all their older games yes it includes your dlcs if u are not planning to keep games (and dlcs alive then stop adding your retarded drm to it i dont want your uplay shitty app first heroes 5 then 6 now almost all older games i was planning to buy fenix ryse and odyssey but after this u better serve blowjobs u fucking french monkeys edit this is absurd ubisoft has a guy that responds to most of the steam negative reviews but they wont keep the fucking servers
"['frame rate', 'optimization', 'series', 'graphics']",finally got around to playing and finishing this game for the first time i 've played through it entirely via the steam link worked great by default the game runs poorly often dropping to 30 fps but there 's a couple of tricks you can find on the internet to remedy this to some degree gameplay -wise it 's mostly standard asscreed stuff except for the naval elements which work very well with the plot and setting i greatly enjoyed playing it i 'd recommend picking it up
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'combat', 'stealth', 'movement', 'series']",this is the last title that feels like assassin 's creed everything else after should have been renamed black flag is the best pirate game next to atlas hands down the ground combat ship battles stealth and parkour all mix together very well for the most part the historical events are still accurate much like the previous ones with a few liberties it 's worth getting if you never played since you get absolutely all content for a cheap price you still need to worry about the stupid launcher though the only reason i won 't buy any ubisoft games overall 10 /10. fixed all the mistakes of iii and perfected it
['entertainment value'],the best 100h of my gaming life :d
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",one of the best assassin 's creed to date even though it almost has nothing to do with the assassin 's. the world that you have to discover is just huge and can take you hours and hours to get every collectible to hunt so you can craft upgrades to battle with other ships the good -immersive world to discover -great story -good atmosphere -shanties -underwater treasures and i 'm sure that i 'm forgetting something the bad -none from me
['no topic'],10 /10 really good gameplay
"['storyline', 'pirate theme']",best entry in the series since ezio and altaïr though you might tire of the rather same ol ac formula the open world sea borne shenanigans are some of the best fun you 'll have in an ac game be it diving wrecks for treasure or capturing mechantmen and navy vessels for profit all to the sound of your crew bellowing out shanties ..i met the finest ram sir that ever was fed on hay
['series'],best game of ac franchise
"['series', 'entertainment value']",the great pinnacle of this game series just buy it on sale w / dlc it so damn worth it
['no topic'],the abstergo shit is so stupid like let me play the game
['no topic'],this game is by far one of the best games of the year
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'series', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",i absolutely loved assassin 's creed iv black flag ironically it felt the least like an assassin 's creed stealth game but damnit was it so much fun to play it is absolutely one of the best in the series it 's a hell of a pirate game the best one i 've ever played and was just a blast playing from beginning to end by the end my love for this era and world was just rekindled beautiful locations and attention to detail exploring the vast seas building your ship hunting down the royal navy finding lost treasures and most importantly a great engaging story with a main character whom you are keen on seeing his journey unfold before him i loved it highly recommended and the historical accuracy of this game is shockingly amazing as usual again does not feel like an assassin 's creed game ironically and with the exception of assassin 's creed ii being a masterpiece this comes very close definitely in the top 3 of the best ac game of all time for me buy it
['series'],the best one of the series even to this day get this over every other ac
['pirate theme'],this game is absolute proof that ubisoft can make great games when they encourage piracy rather than trying to prevent it
"['pirate theme', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'movement', 'entertainment value']",easy the best of the assassin 's creed franchise and that is saying a lot although some of the series is to be kind bad you really get the sense of being a pirate every man 's dream and it somewhat historically accurate i loved seeing this old carribean towns when they were first starting for example jamacia with it 's surronding jungles and flauna and animals walking amound the ruins of the earthquake small towns that of course are now huge it 's all great from a historic standpoint alone i also had fun just running around pushing people in the water the ship battles are great and yes although you are a bit of a superman the fights are still fun one of the most fun games i played in years i highly recommend
"['no topic', 'pirate theme']",the best one in the franchise by far the naval aspect is no gimmick it 's implemented to perfection
['no topic'],plz remake this :c:c:c:c
"['optimization', 'frame rate']",a bit slow on my dinosaur laptop but worth the lag <3
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",an interesting assassin 's creed where you play a pirate probably one of the best arcade naval game available if you don 't like this part forget about the game it 's an important one if you like this part the rest of the game is really great too a lot of unlockables to track and things to do
['uplay'],refunded after 3 hours of trying to redeem the key on my linked ubisoft connect account and having it say ubisoft 's servers were unreachable
['uplay'],uplay is gay
['series'],my favourite assassin 's creed game by a mile not even a competition they will never make an assassin 's creed game like this again if you didn 't play it by now just do it you won 't regret it
['no topic'],wait ...just...just one more ship
['storyline'],best ac yet and probably my favourite game ever made there is so much content and the story is pretty good too 9 .75/10
['no topic'],stop looking at the reviews and play this game already
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'exploration', 'combat', 'graphics']","assassin 's creed 4 black flag doesn 't really want to be an assassin 's creed game and i don 't blame it it seems keen to shrug off the oblique convoluted lore surrounding the eon -long assassins vs templar power struggle which managed to reach new peaks of ludicrousness even after that bit in the second game when you punch the pope into unconsciousness in order to access an alien hologram black flag stuffs all that into a box labelled 'whoops', throws it down a deep dark hole and sends you on third -person free -running murder missions on the high seas instead by blackbeard 's bushy eyebrows that is a welcome move you are edward kenway a rogue who loves money enough to leave his girlfriend in port and sail to the west indies in search of a vast fortune in the opening scenes he steals an assassin 's hooded garb and wristblades and accidentally falls in with a crowd of templars a team of comedy evil caricatures led by a bearded grand master and backed up by a plate armoured man -ogre who throws axes at people they 're searching for the observatory an ancient device that enables its user to see the location of anyone in the world at any time the templars want it because it 'll make coups easier the assassins want it to stop the templars and kenway wants it because it 's probably the most valuable thing on the planet if that sounds a bit removed from piracy and plunder don 't worry after the two -hour hand -holding tutorial section mercifully shorter than in previous assassin 's creed games the observatory is relegated to distant long -term objective status and the story refocuses on the building of the pirate paradise of nassau a lawless little utopia maintained by a collection of criminals seeking respite from the attention of the law that means kenway isn 't exactly an assassin he has all the free -running, jumping and killing skills of the sect a genetic bonus it 's implied but his relationship with the series morally ambiguous order of murder monks is fractious that keeps the plot 's severest absurdities at arm 's length and lets you just be a pirate and do pirate things hang out with famous brigands like james kidd watch affable rogue edward teach become an unhinged scenery -chewing blackbeard sail across the ocean rob ships fight the british take sea forts for yourself harpoon whales explore large coastal cities such as havana and raid ancient aztec ruins for treasure all this in a beautiful tropical open world that 's at its glowing hyper -detailed best on pc on land much is familiar hubs such as havana and nassau are large but there are no urban spaces to match the size and spectacle of rome or constantinople a shame certainly but there 's still a huge amount to explore in scattered settlements across black flag 's massive archipelago you 'll sail between stilted pier towns tucked away in rocky alcoves tropical islands sprinkled with treasure chests and larger townships like the manicured orderly haven of kingston as always you have to climb to high perches to scout sections of town revealing chests stores and sidequests in the area the latter including a welcome increase in open -world assassination missions and warehouse raids these place targets in open areas patrolled by british or spanish forces and invite you to solve the problem creatively such missions feel closer to the original vision for assassin 's creed than the scripted story segments which while much improved over assassin 's creed iii 's restrictive and buggy offerings are still rather over -reliant on lengthy follow tasks to raid a warehouse you must first scan the area for the key holder pickpocket it off him (or rob his corpse and then make your way to the door without being shot dead by elevated musket snipers and roaming guards stealth has been tightened up to make this more interesting pervasive jungle foliage offers constant cover and targets can be marked using kenway 's magic 'eagle vision mode which lets you track guards through walls a serious advantage yes but you no longer have access to the silent ranged instant -kill throwing knives that made similar challenges trivial in previous games"

"['storyline', 'graphics', 'combat', 'optimization', 'movement', 'customer support', 'series', 'character', 'music']",what is the franchise about and what is the game like ? simply put like the batman arkham franchise in historical costumes third person parcour forgiving stealthy or go loud game which is not meant to completely run gun i played the first two titles before black flag here is my impression on this one what remained : beautiful large open world great atmosphere love to detail regarding historical costumes senseless meta story repetitive elements nice puzzle minigames entering terminals though to a lesser extent than the previous episodes had as with the other parts too many collectibles simply to inflate playtime what improved : naval battles are fun and intuitive capturing an enemy 's vessel is great key bindings for pc players make more sense and are easier compared to ac1 2 the shanty catching quests are a worthy replacement for the race ontop of the roofs parcour challenges what got worse : berserk darts are simply game -breaking due to their long range the poison syringe in ac2 already made things a lot easier but this is an overkill besides the animations are far more boring and it makes no sense that someone on a berserk dart kills the own people but spares civis was much more fun in ac2 second point is the new climbing system which might have been introduced together with ac3 it is beautiful if you can leap seemlessly from branch to branch in the forests but the same mechanics let you clinch on every corner or jump ontop of treasure chests you simply wanted to open up this was always a problem but since the parcour part used to be a little harder w /o this change that glitch didn 't happen that often before the corruption of statistical information aka 'progress tracker now even subquests are added to the main story 's tracker and some values like collectibles are counted double (as 'location' and as 'side activity this slows the progress increase down for a looong time ok eavesdropping events are a staple of the franchise but this has gone overboard to me with this one same goes for the tail -your-man missions skins impossible to use because they were rewards of long -gone community challenges unbelievable what i like about this franchise is that real contemporary characters (mere commoners not just the famous ones are picked according to their value to the story so the backstory to these characters is always authentic like a merchant turned pirate or a nun opening up a brothel in renaissance italy the story is the same since part 1 though and quite incoherent this time these contemporary characters are rather thrown in than fitted in nicely ok the barmaid turns pirate for the looks of it but adewale complaining about searching for a fairy tale castle though he should be most appreciative of the whole crew being an assassin ? outfits which contain stat boosts are meh if i can 't choose them and simply add the boost most of the time the puffy native indian outfit is the most useful which is sad indeed the rope darts are given for the last 20 of the main story and nobody knows why since there is anyway enough to make this game far easier than the previous parts but what an amazing game this could have been if the marketing department had less of a say in it the real meta story of the game which was well fit in between all the character information is the battle between devs and marketing department which was added as some ironic side twist in a form of managerial comments 'should we mention slavery people want to hear postive stuff this picking on stupid marketing department phrases makes this game really worthwhile besides it is an enjoyable but repetitive game if it wasn 't for the nice caribbean environment and the cool navy battles this part would be worse than ac2 .
"['storyline', 'combat', 'graphics', 'series', 'optimization', 'customer support']","without doubt the best in the series rating 9 /10 pros loaded with content i have probably spent 50 hours on this game in the first play -through, going to obscure islands just out of curiosity naval battles are very well made and a lot of fun team did an excellent job even if sailing was just a side -note, the team did make it an excellent and alluring mechanic so much so that its absence in the later titles is very prominent (a clear void in those titles berserker darts i just can 't get enough of firing an 'lsd dart into an enemy and let him go berserk on his companions hilarious sleep darts firing a sleep dart at a monkey in a tree and watching it plunge to the ground is also a sight to see (note: no virtual animal hurt by such act for those concerned great graphics runs at 60 fps steady on my core i4770 and gtx 1080 1920x1200 only ubisoft game i 've played through more than once the later titles were such a disappointment that i just rebooted this installment instead when i had an itch for sword buckling or naval battles cons ubisoft repetition and busy work it feels that once the game was done a separate team came in and sprinkled busy -work all over the place fetching shanties all over the map pieces of paper that once you trip their bounding box set off on an invisible rail really not a fun mechanic however the reward the songs the crew sing are pretty awesome but the act of getting them is not lost opportunities regarding loot again a gazillion loot -boxes scattered randomly across the map if ubi had spent a little time providing challenges for getting the loot it 'd have been much more enjoyable e .g. requiring some sort of infiltration / diversion would have turned these chores from forgettable and boring activities into semi -fun ones (depending on the effort spent on creating the mini -scenarios). loading time entering and exiting the ship 's cabin felt like transitioning between two games as it took as long as shutting down a game and rebooting another entering the cabin is something you 'll do when you need to direct your fleet (earn further profit so the game *forces* you to suffer through the loading screens if you want to take part of that particular game loop overall this title is up there with the likes of witcher 3 and is the crowning jewel in the ubisoft catalog i only wish for a follow -up, with similar diversity and attention to detail but seeing what came after this title in the series chance of that happening seems slim to none"
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'combat', 'graphics']",this is probably the best ac game i 've played so far previous titles made me uninstall them after a couple of hours but this one is absolutely solid and enjoyable experience the story is interesting and has some unexpected plot twists the whole 'pirate' stuff is also nice and fun to do unfortunately the combat system is still about mashing two buttons until all your enemies are dead naval battles are better but with some upgrades your ship becomes way too powerful and even high ranked enemy ships can 't stop you hunting is fun but when you got everything you need becomes useless graphics looks pretty and effects like smoke and fog are really well done overall ac iv is absolutely worth purchaising and speding your time among the carribean pirates

"['assassin theme', 'character', 'storyline', 'pirate theme']",this is by far one of the best assassins creeds out there right next to assassins creed ii edward kenway and the supporting characters are just as memorable as ezio auditore and the characters in the second game humor drama action romance it has it all you can either progress through the story or just spend hours being a pirate and taking over other ships for goods 10 /10

"['series', 'graphics', 'optimization', 'entertainment value']",black flag release date 2013 origins release date 2017 odyssey release date 2018 black flag looks better and runs better best radio station in the videogame industry 10 /10
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'exploration', 'character', 'entertainment value']",black flag was simply awesome i have not played an assassins creed game since acii i downloaded odyssey and got lost early on so i picked up black flag cheap ive spent about 23 hours just pirating all the ships in the caribbean and making my ship look terrifying the main character is f ******ng badass awesome game
['uplay'],great game but i gotta give a shout out to the other reviewers who were complaining about uplay there 's a little more to the installation than usual but if you download the current version of uplay first then come back to steam to buy the game you can plug the cd key in and you 're good to go it 's been fun just proceed with caution
['graphics'],i like so much because it have a beatiful graphics
"['optimization', 'frame rate', 'movement', 'combat', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'series', 'character', 'music', 'entertainment value']",this is my absolute favourite game so i need to leave a review i 've completed it at least twice on xbox 360 and decided to get it on pc as well i 'll start with the negatives  this is not the most optimised game on pc i was expecting to play on very high settings and i was wrong i've been having some issues with the framerate and have to use a third -party program to get around them the freerunning controls can often send you climbing up a nearby object when you intend to do something else once you get the hang of melee combat it becomes very easy the modern -day story isn 't anything special but it 's still alright  and now for the positives  absolutely beautiful locations this game takes me to paradise the water . i could drink it all of it loveable characters you'll get sad when they die . a shanty for everyone a great story in my opinion it 's not too assassin -y so it can be a breath of fresh air from the other games there's plenty to do but you don 't have to do all of it  this game was the gateway drug that got me into the rest of the series i 'd recommend it at full price but if you can get it on sale it 's a bargain
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'character', 'series', 'entertainment value']",wow there 's really not much to say this game is as good as ac ii and brotherhood brilliant plot great characters stunning locations absolutely fantastic gameplay experience good (but not great modern day story and if you love pirates of the carribean then stop reading this and buy the game already cause it 's the best 'pirate simulator to date lol final verdict 9 /10
['no topic'],do not buy ubisoft giving out bad codes and then being like sorry we can 't do anything
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics']",black flag is an excellent open -world adventure with a likeable protagonist it is a comprehensive improvement over its lacklustre predecessor assassin ’s creed 3 there are plenty of interesting side tasks to keep you busy for dozens of hours the ship combat remains satisfying for just as long and ship upgrades feel worthwhile while the campaign has a few poor eavesdropping missions they are offset by quality varied content you can spend your time finding buried treasure whale hunting ship -wreck diving plundering convoys or basic assassinations the caribbean setting is the perfect change for the franchise and the engine produces a sublime atmosphere ac4 is a truly impressive pirate experience without the unpleasantness of scurvy or dysentery
"['graphics', 'series', 'uplay']",best foliage and soil effect in rain and storm among ac games rating 8 .8/10 pros no need to tell you know everything except after completing every abstergo challenge you will get skeleton crew con 1 uplay 2 uplay
"['pirate theme', 'combat']",wow this game is so amazing we can play with family in the action of killed any people my mom was scared when edward kill all templars this game was have a good pirating mechanics good world still worth in 2021 love mom
['pirate theme'],bloody pirates
"['storyline', 'combat', 'errors']",basically traditional assassin 's creed game with ship battle very detailed world and interesting character ships are a very good addition to the game but it can get repetitive and grindy but it 's interesting to have both naval battle and land battle which make the game more interesting some bugs are seldom present throughout the game but it doesn 't affect the game in general the only major flaw in this game would be the story most if not all of the 'main' characters are very well developed but they just disappear during the story or somehow managed to die so i end up with some other characters that i meet in the middle of the game and they are not properly introduced and developed
"['series', 'optimization', 'uplay', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character']","if you 've waited this long to try it out on pc you are a bit late no doubt black flag has a lot to offer new and old audiences but i do feel that its age is finally catching up to it and by that i mean ubisoft would rather kill off older games than maintain people 's ability to play them https ://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/gameplay/article/decommissioning-of-online-services-for-older-ubisoft-games-october-2022-update/000102396 while not on the list *yet*, it would appear this will be a recurring procedure that will eventually take down gamers ability to use many features features like link cross -accounts/platforms and online play will no longer be possible nor will players be able to access *any* dlc for the game regardless if you 've already paid for it or not eventually this game will crumble on pc until ubisoft decides to hd remaster it and will again milk all those wanting to play it again outside of this the game has still aged to a point where it 's lost its shine my primary complaint is that having jumped into it so late much of what made this game special has already been employed in so many other games the pirating ship portions are still pretty unique but they already felt shallow and too on the rails the campaign and missions play just like any of the previous ac games and fail to offer anything new outside of pirating which is a fun but limited experience only truly enjoyed outside of the restrictions of the campaign what it does offer is a fun backdrop and setting in which you can play an assassin 's creed game in not being a huge fan of the assassin 's creed series this is the most fun i 've had in one that all said what does it really matter if the publisher /developer is trashing the game anyway have fun while you can"
"['series', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'exploration']",still the best in the series for my money the culmination of everything that was good in past releases and laying the groundwork for everything 's that 's coming up next (sometimes to it 's detriment like the unbelievable amount of randomly place collectibles spread around the map no other pirate game gets roaming and looting through the caribbeans this right
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'graphics', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'series', 'music']","what is assassin 's creed 4 in 2 words a perfect pirate game this game was the last good ac before reboot in 2017 story as in ac3 story is about a simple person with simple desires edward is just as any young men who want to get rich but as far he goes on the more price he would pay and in final when he get to the edge only then he understand what he did and accept his road but keep moving foward to change himself and to go in the right way this story is more interesting that in ac2 because is very easy to relate with this protagonist for me story in ac4 it 's strong and different from previous games which is very good sidequests are half interesting (assassins kills and half boring (all rest because is typical ubisoft game gameplay we will start with combat combat was slightly change to be faster also has been added a lot of tools to variate aproach to achieve the goal of missions but the design of levels is 50 good and 50 boring because of that cqb doesn 't give you much pleasure parkour has been downgraded because architecture of buildings has been simplified the diamond of gameplay is sea travels and sea fights even now they are the best in game industry you have 4 types of weapons different speeds and moves also ship is very interesting to develop the atmosphere of being pirate better than in black flag hasn 't been developed in any other game audio visual  it looks good for a game from 2013 but models and texture are outdated if we compare with modern games audio part in simple sounds good music awesome tech part  black flag was first ac which want from you pc a lot of resources if ac3 runned well on my pc in black flag on medium settings sometime framerate drops by 33 final as brotherhood black flag enter in the best part of this franchise and key feature of this game was reduce the credo 's theme and focuse more on storyteling of simple person this make big difference with previous games of the series .but also because a ot of this are simplifed (cqb, design of lcoations this game doesn 't feel as masterpiece or something outstanding just a good action -adventure game also black flag was first ac game where mdfckers from ubi putted microtransaction to see how much money he can get from this in result all new ubi games has microtransations 8 .5/10"

"['customer support', 'errors']",this will be the second review i have ever written on steam i just feel i need to share my experience with others i bought the game because it seems perfect it looks like everything i want from a game anyway i purchased it and tried to play it immediately it crashed and continued to do so with every attemp for the next few days i send a support request in to ubisoft just a few days after the purchase but it takes them a month before they answer anyway i am now glad that someone on the support side is here to help me and i get my hopes up for a solution soon after almost three weeks of very frequent e -mailing back and forth trying new things troubleshooting sending files back and forth re -installing the game uplay steam and even windows several times i grow tired and express and i no longer have the time nor energy to continue the seemingly fruitless efforts to be able to play the game i ask for a refund and the reply i get is what enrages me the most i am told that i am no longer eligable for a refund since more than two weeks have past since purchasing the game i find this disgusting considering i have never been able to play the game at all and they are the ones who took great time in their first response this is the first time i have bought a game from ubisoft that utilizes their uplay platfrom but now i shall never purchase anything from them ever again because of their greedy stupidity you might be one the lucky ones who will be able to play the game and you will probably love it too but if things go south don 't expect any help if it doesn 't work straight away send it back straight away
['series'],one of the best assassins creed games out there
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'graphics', 'series', 'entertainment value']",black flag is as big of an improvement over aciii as acii was over the original assassin 's creed while aciii took the series trademark parkour gameplay mechanics and applied them to an open world much of that world 's freedom was limited or illusory black flag makes the biggest leap forward the series has taken yet by giving you true freedom to go wherever you please whenever you please unlike aciii 's overlong prologue black flag thrusts you right into the action and has you at the helm of a seafaring vessel very early after a few introductory missions the game centers itself squarely around sailing naval combat which gels with the spirit magic of assassin 's creed 's distinctive gameplay there are a huge array of side quests and tangential self -contained missions alongside the main story which you can go through at your own pace and the light rpg elements return in the form of levelling up your weapons and ship as you progress through new waters what makes this formula special isn 't the plot or characters (some are likeable though not particularly memorable but the world they inhabit so alive it practically pulses with its own energy in a unique fictional slice of history combined with freedom of exploration activity i 've spent hours at a time sailing aimlessly through the sun -filled isles of the west indies simply watching the weather change or engaging in naval battles and looting ships before taking to shore to stretch my legs and run through the jungles of deserted isles or the dense populace and buildings of bigger cities there are buried treasures and letters in bottles to be found across a large map a variety of animals to hunt in different regions to craft upgrades and new outfits and even underwater swimming sections in which you evade sharks and other deep -sea dangers in pursuit of sunken wealth gone is the overarching present -day storyline featuring desmond co (which had grown very stale and convoluted the animus returns but in an entirely new context that 's creative fun and features some ingenious meta -game narrative flourishes black flag is in my opinion by far the best assassin 's creed game to date (including the newer generation entries such as unity and syndicate with the more dated and linear yet still brilliant acii trailing behind it injected a sense of wonder adventure into a series that had grown stale and it gives players the closest experience they 'll have to being a seafaring pirate during the golden age of piracy it may be the best naval action game ever made and it combines the best elements of the series with a true open world sandbox i still marvel over and bound around in to this day whether you 're already an initiated assassin 's creed fan or new to the series this comes with my highest recommendation as it 's one of the best adventure games in recent memory a solid a (9.5/10).
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",the fourth numbered entry in the assassin 's creed series that proudly carries all that a title like that entails i 'll keep this short for people by assuming that those reading know the basics of these games and i 'll specifically go over the biggest changes since assassin 's creed 3 ship combat has been improved and is a far larger part of the game than previously i 'm sure that this is assumed since you 're a pirate now but the developers outdid themselves and made it an absolute blast you can now upgrade pretty much every aspect of your ship several levels by acquiring resources to do so how you ask good old fashioned piracy blast an enemy ship to the point of almost sinking and you can swing aboard for some good old swashbuckling which will net you resources crew materials to repair your ship and even additional ships to do your bidding in the fleet mini -games. in an abstract sense i almost felt like i was playing a modern sid meier 's pirates when i was sailing about the caribbean as per usual in assassin 's creed the ancestor 's story was great and very engaging but the blasts to the present frequently bored me to tears in this game even moreso than the others i often wished that ac was composed entirely of the memory sequences instead of any of the abstergo entertainment garbage edward kenway the protagonist and connor from ac3 's grandfather is an interesting character who i enjoyed playing as a drunken pirate with a love of plunder who rides a character arc that ends with him growing as an individual he fit the atmosphere perfectly and really fit the bill the supporting cast was also fantastic and i found that i grew attached to several of the characters over the course of the game each was well written and had an interesting arc of their own in the game 's story i highly recommend this game to fans of the series as well as any who are looking for a good stealth game with fun combat mechanics and /or a great piracy simulator the freedom cry dlc is also very much worth it on a sale price and will provide several hours of entertainment playing a character that contrasts edward to the extreme aveline on the other hand is enjoyable but very much a demo offering only about half an hour of play
"['storyline', 'character', 'combat', 'series', 'exploration', 'movement', 'graphics']","black flag was the first game i ever 'reviewed' on my steam account and as such i didn 't give it any real justice black flag is herald as one if not the best of the series and for good reason it brings us an interesting protagonist with solid naval gameplay it has its drawbacks sure but it ultimately turns into a wonderful experience all around i 'm not usually keen on playing 'yet another white male but edward 's depth really sold me on him he has a perfectly understandable outlook of 'i want walls that hold back the wind and cold i want food that doesn 't taste like dust this is not an exact quote as i 'm reinstalling after probably a year since i 've played it last but that is effectively his motive to not be poor this leads him to the pirate life (or 'privateers' as he tries to convince his girlfriend that going away for a year is what 's best for them and further leads into his snarky devil -may-care attitude he gets plenty of dialog that shows the full gamut of personality that involves greed fear worry confusion and bravery this is how you write a character people the game does not waste time getting edward in his own ship with mechanics you might recall were tapped into in ac3 but never utilized and was mostly stuck in an optional gimmick it returns here in full blast with solid broadside mechanics that eventually turn into a melee as you render enemy ships inert you follow through on a couple of objectives and call it a victory it 's one of my favorite aspects of the game and even includes a sort of ship -based stealth mission or two as you try to navigate your ship through swamps avoid massive man o war 's, and risk exploring contested waters if there 's a drawback it 's that the game focuses so much on the naval combat (which, again is wonderful that the on -foot missions suffer greatly most of them involve following a mark around and staying within an audio bubble to hear them properly they are frequently irritating and not as interesting as the more straightforward assassinations that the series is known for for those who felt the 'modern day segments were a blight they thankfully take more of a backseat here you step into the role of a voiceless employee that navigate the headquarters on your off -time and suss out the secrets of the company ultimately you are whomever you wish to be and exploring is largely optional as most of the time you can just 'log back in and go straight back into the game proper regardless of one 's opinion on ubisoft and recent business practices i highly recommend you get this game even if you 're not a fan of the franchise black flag stands on its own two feet and you won 't need to know a lot of lore to be invested in edward 's personal journey please get this game"
"['series', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",one of the best version of assissin 's creed series exellent service exellent graphics (beautifull world texture best best best game highly recommended this version assissin 's creed 4 best singleplayer and multiplayer game in the assassin 's creed series
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'assassin theme']",fun and bountyful loved the vastness of the map tons of activities and collectibles haven 't 100 the game yet spent 150 glorious hours pillaging and plundering the caribbean seafaring is fun story is good especially the pirate parts action is great free -running controls are a bit clunky so you may fail pursuit challenges at times my only gripe with the game is the fact the amount of assassination contracts is finite
['errors'],fucking dogshit key activation problems cant even play the game i bought
"['series', 'character', 'storyline', 'optimization']",one of best ac games alongside altair and ezio serie favorable protag just like ezio intense story with minimal boring fillers the devs did put their heart in this gem and it 's clear by day it 's filled with fun side activities like hunting whales 70 of your playtime is on ships you 're not climbing much or anything near ezio series assassinations you 're missing huge arsenal of assassination weapons and techniques brotherhood or revelation had but i felt as much joy as i had with ezio series the downside is the optimization is not great keep nvidia physx to normal and some main story optional objectives require preparation before the quest overall 9 /10 a true ac don 't miss this gem grab it the moment it goes on sale
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",i 've never been that much of an assassin 's creed fan but this time ubisoft managed to put together a fantastic title they seemed to have picked up the ground combat stealth and complexity of their cities from their previous games and combined it in a land and sea open world along with exploration and hunting elements clearly borrowed from farcry 3 and of course they elevated the naval combat from assassin 's creed 3 to a whole new level in black flag you can engage in countless activities such as whaling boarding poor unsuspecting merchant barges assassination contracts or simply exploration there 's just so much to do though by far the activities done at sea are the most fun for those who played or still remember sea dogs and later pirates of the caribean this title is definetely reminiscent of those and is definetely worth it for those who have never experienced the joys of looting and pludering this is also a must play at some point

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'graphics', 'series', 'character', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'exploration', 'music']",okay assassin 's creed iv black flag is an awesome game i would recommend this to whose never play assassin 's creed before especially for anyone who like the pirate stories open world sailing with ship naval battle and aboard to another ship is the best adventures that the game offers to us gameplay is ease but still challenging suit with any gamers playstyle the storyline and characters are great has some touching moments that sometimes maybe will make you cry but still i hate when the story going outside the animus environments are so beautiful tropical forest and ocean are wonderful (of course with a great graphic card :p). voice acting is well done as well they 're good at singing combat is great just same like other third person games the upgrade system is pretty good you want easy battles then go hard at finding upgrade material or you don 't want find material then go hard at battles cons maybe not fully perfect port to pc some fps drop to 30 may be found outside animus gameplay every times it on going i always say 'the hell is this just back to kenway story overall this is the best ac story ending (aside from ezio story i really do enjoy this game and always trying rush on main story because it just make me curious characteristic enviroment are just so fabulous and for combat / naval mechanic are awesome maybe this game is underrated (i know some people may feel disgusted with ac series but just give it a try for this one may you will fall into the storyline 9 /10 for it

"['storyline', 'graphics', 'frame rate', 'exploration', 'entertainment value', 'uplay']",now that my journey as a pirate has come to an end is time to make a small but incisive review this is one of the best games i 've played ever i just loved the plot i mean the story was so immersive and theres is so much to do the graphics where stunning but with a disapointment which is it cant be played at 144hz only 60hz so with my 144hz 2k 1ms g -sync monitor i felt kinda sad because if you know what 144hz gsync gaming is you know what im talking about and 60hz just hurts your eyes anyways the world is huge and there is so much to keep you ocupied for 1 month straight thank you ubisoft for making this game and i apologize for not having played it sooner im off to ac rogue now wish me luck #road2origins
['no topic'],you shouldn't buy any ubisoft games they are grossly anti-consumer and will not hesitate to deny you access to the games and/or dlc you paid for
"['storyline', 'pirate theme']",i got to say it was a bit slow at the start but the more i got into it the more i love the game and the story yes the raiding the ship and upgrades take a bit of time to do but worth it in the end and the ending is the best part 9 /10
"['storyline', 'combat', 'difficulty', 'pirate theme']",the best of the series in my opinion fantastic gameplay good story some relatively difficult puzzles to solve and being a pirate what more could you ask for the only thing i didn 't care as much for was the fleet operations the 'battles' took too long to resovle considering it simply being turn -based combat simulation i didn 't think the time spent in what is essentially a mini -game was worthwhile luckily it 's completely optional everything else i enjoyed and will likely have another play -through or two in the future
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'assassin theme', 'exploration', 'character', 'series', 'graphics', 'entertainment value', 'music']",i have played this game extensively on the xbox 360 and xbox one i just started again on the pc at any rate the game is fantastic and the sea oh good lord the sea is beautiful the water in this game is just fabulous this game features epic sea battles as well cannon fire boarding enemy ships sword fighting gun shooting knife throwing cutting down enemy flags in victory adding the ship to your fleet or sinking it to the depths of davy jones locker one of the better assassins creed games in my honest opinion oh and did i mention sea shanties no well they are rather good try and collect them all so here is the thing it would be ideal for you to have played at least assassins creed 2 first however that is up to you the game is brilliant either way good story good characters good game play 9 /10 you should buy
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'combat', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",one of ubisoft 's triple a titles assassin 's creed iv black flag (ac4: bf further expands the assassin 's creed universe not only in terms of the plot but in gameplay as well it 's rare to find a game that builds off of so much material but ac4 bf stands out against the traditional video game since it offers a variety of side -quests or mini -games. within ac4 bf there is crafting naval fleet management trading item collection hunting harpooning piracy exploring and of course the third -person assassination missions that we all know and love from the franchise ac4 bf is absolute fun and has become the premier pirate game everything from the diverse gameplay to the graphics and sounds ac4 bf is not to be passed up by any self -respecting gamer as it is what video games should be delivering in terms of experience

"['uplay', 'series', 'customer support']",great game so far but i 'm at the point at the game where i have to use the fleet map which requires you to be signed in to ubisoft servers i can 't progress his almost 10 year old single player game because the servers have been down for weeks

"['storyline', 'combat', 'series', 'graphics', 'errors']",i think the game is a big improvement over the 3rd one i do not enjoy that much combat over ships but i ended up being fond of it the story is a bit weird outside the animus as you don 't really get to have any connection with the character that goes inside the animus desmond will be missed for sure the game was pretty decent and i am hoping to see how the rest of the series are i am a huge fan of the game franchise and so far i think i enjoy it to the point that i managed to finish it and actually have a good time playing it unlocking everything i could in my opinion here is the score i will give gameplay 7 (slightly better than previous games but not formidable the story inside animus 8 (probably the best pirate game experience you can get the story outside animus 5 (disconnected with the character and the story it was trying to present graphics 8 (i think for its age the game has good graphics bugs every now and then the game got me stuck in places but this happened rarely glitches are common too overall score 8 it was a good game and it 's worth playing never the less

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'graphics', 'series', 'entertainment value']",assassin 's creed 4 to this day is up there in my top favorite games i loved the naval battles and traveling around with the ship and listening to shanties the story of edward kenway is a sad one because you get to make bonds with people just to lose one after the other until none remain really liked the story of the game the combat was awesome with the dual swords and 4 pistols the world is really beautiful and well made as with the previous games i hit 100 sync and this time around it was a breeze compared to ac 3 where it was a chore to do freedom cry was a good side content story adewale is one of my favorite sidekicks in the assassin 's creed games and was glad he got his own story i liked this story more than the liberation sh *t storm since in this you actually do something to help the slaves escape 100 sync was not hard since this is a small 9 mission story dlc good base game with a good dlc worth buying to enjoy the sailing and listening to shanties i give this a 8 .5/10

"['music', 'series']",easily in my top 10 games of all time list this game is worth buying to hear the soundtrack alone i adore this game to pieces the main and one of the only things that bothers me is that the cities feel quite lackluster and don 't have much personality like they do in earlier assassin 's creed games other than that they took what they had created in assassin 's creed iii and developed it into a true masterpiece i can heartily recommend this game
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",one of the best ac games that i ever played
['entertainment value'],this game is amazing you must play yhis game
['errors'],i feel like ubisoft stole the game i paid for with this patch
"['pirate theme', 'series']",my faveourite of the ac series whilst it was a good ac game it was a great pirate game the remaster of sid meiers pirates you 've always wanted had some issues with multiplayer and world events though nonetheless i enjoed the game and have played it severeal times through
"['storyline', 'combat', 'character', 'series', 'music']",7 years later just as addictive if it weren 't for the annoying tailing missions i would say this is the best ac out there after ezio the gameplay loop is genius you really feel like a pirate naval combat is tremendously well done it still holds up edward is just as intriguing unlike other ac protags his motivation is very raw he just wants wealth side characters are wonderfully done blackbeard steals the show music is extremely nostalgic brings me right back to my xbox 360 days buy this even if you 're not into ac because it 's an excellent pirate sim the best out there even now
"['errors', 'uplay']",doesn't even launch game asks for cd-key and when you put it in it says that the ubisoft servers are down they're not the servers are still up and even after trying the next day it still wouldn't work waste of money
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",i think i liked this one the most cause it had the least amount to do with assasins creed and is one of the best single player pirate games you can buy not saying i hate assasins creed but yeah this game took the one thing i loved about assasins creed 3 and made an entire game out of it
"['series', 'optimization', 'combat', 'exploration', 'music', 'pirate theme', 'storyline']",though i haven 't even finished it yet (40 hours in it 's absolutely safe to say that this is the best ac title i like it way better then the second they reduced the city size and made three smaller ones which reduces unwanted running around for kilometers though overall mapsize is bigger the best part is out on sea imho the battles you can have there are just amazing it all depends on the upgrade system if you 're able to take on three man 'o'wars or not :d in the beginning even some smaller ships can sink you in seconds xd and cruising around the sea while listening to your pirate singing shanties is just awesome (leave her johnny leave her fighting is still overpowered but enemies can hit you easier then in previous titles which is a plus imho freerunning is as awesome as always but can be clunky sometimes but that 's mostly yourself being to hectic with the controls :d and the pirate theme just fits so great into this setting honestly go buy this if you like ac titles and if you don 't liked them before start with this
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'character', 'series', 'graphics', 'entertainment value', 'music']",so a review for a game about pirates as a guy who generally favours the ninja side of things alright i 'll give this a go ac4 black flag is a great game as long as you 're not expecting to be an assassin or play an assassin 's creed game this game is centered around edward kenway who impersonates an assassin traitor and gets embroiled into the big fight right sort of if i had to summarize the story of ac4 i would say kenway is a jerk and has a 'turn of heart but only after everything around him has collapsed . you get to be an assassin for all of 1 or 2 sequences did i thus not like this game au contraire this is a fantastic game it has exploration galore with collectibles of all kinds scattered around the map there 's arbitrary challenges for you to complete (some of which were fun the game is centered around sailing a boat which was a nice change of pace the sailing mechanic works and it is fun (up to a degree upgrading your boat feels rewarding in many ways i got to feel that the boat was a more developing character than kenway was that said i feel ac4 is absolutely worth the trouble it has a story and it 's not terrible the plot twists are ridiculously predictable but it 's all good swashbuckling fun it has an interesting perspective on the time of privateers and swashbucklers the overworld plot is i suppose not terrible which is a good change of pace from ac3 in conclusion i have spent many many hours on this game and that is not because i didn 't like it i like the core mechanics of this game it 's fun to do stuff in the open world it 's just that the story didn 't appeal to me at all i got the parallels between the assassin way and the pirate way but ultimately it missed the point of the assassin 's creed experience for me (story wise the music is amazing and ultimately the game 's ending is good (note: not the same as a 'happy' ending you 'll have to find that out for yourself i recommend
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'animals']",let me start off by saying this i never had the game on pc before now i played it on ps4 and loved it no story at all or if there was it very poorly done but pirates assassin 's creed iv took the endgame of assassin 's creed iii and upped it by 300 truly the highlight of the game is the jackdaw (your ship and spending long periods of time avoiding sharks in the deep sea for a simple ship upgrade or spending hours pirating ships for materials to build said upgrade honestly i wish the story was better or more enticing but that being said the graphics (even now are still really good i remember i would spend 95 of my time playing this on the jackdaw exploring the various little islands and finding all the treasures and hunting animals to uprade edward as a little side objective
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'graphics']",open world pirates games with some assassin 's creed thing set in golden age of pirates caribbean sea pros the best game about pirates music ambient sound shanties great graphics and effects tons of activities open world details interesting historical characters choice cons some frame -rate issues some bad and repetitive mission score 86
['uplay'],game is good but ubisoft keeps updating the background service requirements so you 'll need an ubisoft account and won 't be able to play offline for the love of god ubisoft please disable ubisoft connect
"['assassin theme', 'graphics', 'storyline']",black flag is competing to be the best assassin 's creed title since assassin 's creed ii great graphic nice detail but short story
"['errors', 'uplay']",thank 's to ubisoft 's dog shit integrated launcher any of their games including this one become almost unplayable i love this game and think it 's amazing but i 'd rather stomp on orphans and eat meals infront of starving children then use ubisoft services
"['graphics', 'optimization']",good game the first game i played on my new pc that blew me away with the visuals and gameplay yarr beware because this game runs bad on my pc so be carefull in the high seas nothing is true everything is permited 10 /10 game 5 /10 pc port
"['assassin theme', 'series', 'storyline', 'exploration']","as far as i 'm concerned this is the best assasins creed to date it has a unique setting (nassau), and really feel a lot different to all the other creed games (which essentially all feel the same boston feels like new york feels like london but this one set on the ocean and the island surrounding nassau really feels like a breath of ffresh air"
['pirate theme'],unitl a legit example is concieved this truly is your quintessential pirate game
"['errors', 'uplay']",impossible to play because ubisoft connect is the worst software in existence
"['pirate theme', 'exploration', 'assassin theme', 'series']",a great open world action pirate themed game with a ton of features the story is alright although the biggest part of the game is up to you as a player to explore what the carribbean islands and seas has to offer go hunt down a royal convoy dive for treasures in a long lost shipwreck or take on your classic role as assassin and do your thing go sneaky or all in guns blazing although it 's a part of the assassin 's creed franchise you are not in my opinion required to play any of the other games in order to enjoy this one the games not especially connected and they all follow a similar plot the game is in my opinion totaly worth the money but wouldn 't hurt to wait for a sale either
"['pirate theme', 'entertainment value']",one of my all time favorite pirate games i played years ago when it was out on ps3 and i was super happy to play again i would recommend as it was alot of fun doing random stuff
['no topic'],best game i ever played
"['graphics', 'optimization', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character']",+great graphics +good optimisation for a sandbox game +interesting story +++++naval combat +pirates and exploration +decent game mechanics with some minor flaws i don 't like assasin 's creed games but this is the exception
['no topic'],good game
"['storyline', 'series']",i like this game and it is best game of assains creed games
['no topic'],good game kept me busy this 2020
['series'],another fantastic game apart of the assassin creed series the game just keeps getting better by every year this game is definately worth it arrrh now go and enjoy that bootay
"['assassin theme', 'graphics', 'uplay']",wow ..what a game ..i was always loyal to assassins creed franchise but after revelations i never bothered for another title even though i own ac iii i never wanted to play it but then i saw some game play videos of the black flag and thought of giving it a try and wow i was amazed what this delivers graphics the game play everything has been improved to a new level the only con i see on this game is that it also requires uplay (as every other ubi game which now we are kinda got over so it 's worth every penny a spended on
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'series', 'graphics']",total masterpiece they actually went back to their roots and released an amazing sequel the way edward acts and associates with the different orders is total gold everything the old games brought they improved on with this one and created a huge world to explore i actually want to explore and do every side quest unlike in ac3 where it was bland and boring edward is a killing machine dual wielding swords and wrecking guards like the good old days new hero new game spot on masterpiece as someone who hated ac3 's version of ship battles i was surprised how much i enjoyed black flag 's. they expanded on the ship battles boarding more guns and rain mortars to destroy more and more to make your ship stronger nothing dragged on or felt out of place the missions were enjoyable and i like how they implemented a rating system for feedback on if you hated the mission or if they were well done also the addition to salvage underwater wrecks and the environment down there was just beautiful the only downside i could see is the story isn 't as gripping as ezio 's story it was good but ezio 's story was just fantastic and untouchable on scales beyond all comparison edward is a pirate he plunders and steals booty that is all he cares about he mocks the creed and laughs doing it although it doesn 't hit the level of legend ezio could hit blackbeard and the other pirates are enjoyable to listen to and work with unlike connor 's story /acquaintances. overall i give this a solid 8 .8/10. also buy freedom 's cry dlc adewale has a great story and was a character i loved in the main story
['series'],the best assassin 's creed nothing to say more 100 recommended
"['movement', 'series']",aside from a few control issues while running /climbing. this is one of my favorite ac games
['uplay'],the game might be good i dont know because i cant connect to uplay to activate it
"['storyline', 'optimization', 'exploration']","after almost 50 hours of gameplay i finally 100 memory synced and the reward wasn 't worth it at all the worst part of the entire thing was doing the mind numbing uncharted chests /fragments, i can explain it in steps ---100% uncharted 1 start sailing your ship 2 open the map and mark a chest /fragment. 3 sail to the chest /fragment. 4 jump off your ship 5 swim to the island 6 climb tree /rock and get your chest /fragment. 7 swim back to your ship 8 climb your ship now repeat steps 1 ~8 76 times until you get all 46 uncharted chests and 30 uncharted fragments but if you ignore that everything else you do is pretty fun i enjoyed sailing the ship but the real fun for me was exploring the lush islands on low settings because the game is horribly optimized also the 'out of the animus stuff is pretty fun to i enjoyed the puzzles they gave you for the activities there and you found out some pretty cool stuff all in all the game just sucked completely 8 /10"
"['series', 'storyline']",assassin 's creed has gone through some serious changes over its history but black flag is where the series truly hit its peak
"['storyline', 'uplay', 'optimization']",black flag is a nice game i haven 't seen an interesting story written with care since far cry 3 from ubisoft all the other games suck at it with repetitive gameplay mechanics so why do i not recommend this ubisoft launcher fucking faggot fucks need to log in everytime and this game doesn 't run well enough for current gen systems pretty surprising for the price you have to pay for such an old game
"['storyline', 'errors']",bought game chase guy through jungle try to find way to zoom the camera out there isn 't one climb vines forced to focus on close up ass get to first port game crashes google the problem lots of people have it try every single fix new drivers new install new nvidia experience booster new files renames moved added taken away manipulate everything that all the solutions tell me to relaunch game crashes at the same part while walking through the first town requested refund i 'm sure this game is fun if you can actually play it
"['pirate theme', 'entertainment value', 'uplay']",pirates are awesome and so is this game also fuck uplay more like udontplay
"['uplay', 'combat']",i shouldn 't have to log in to a separate program to play this game it 's fun but not worth trying to remember my forced uplay account kill uplay let me just play the game
"['storyline', 'series']",still after origins i feel like this is the best ac game story is fantastic
['customer support'],i was really excited to play this game today after purchasing it yesterday however when i tried to activate the product my product key said invalid i have reported the issue to ubisoft they are 'investigating the issue they said i need to keep an eye on the public forum and refused to respond directly to me about this issue personally i would not buy this game at the moment encase it happens to you as well
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'combat', 'stealth']",i just dont know what to say this game is amazing the very best pirate game ive ever played and also an amazing introduction to the assassins creed series good story gorgeous visuals great ship combat decent stealth and assassination mechanics a must play game indeed 10 /10 https ://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2858108178
"['series', 'graphics', 'combat', 'exploration', 'storyline', 'character', 'entertainment value']",najlepsza odsłona serii .wspaniały otwarty świat piękna grafika genialne bitwy morskie wciągająca historia oraz ciekawi bohaterowie dlc bardzo krótkie ale w sumie zawsze to coś polecam 10 /10 eng the best part of the series great open world beautiful graphics brilliant naval battles captivating history and interesting heroes dlc very short but all in all it 's something i would recommend 10 /10
['no topic'],holds up well
"['graphics', 'combat', 'movement', 'stealth']",i haven 't played for very long (and therefore can 't comment on the storyline but here are some first impressions for the digital standard edition 1 the graphics are good and the setting is beautiful (especially the *relatively deserted islands 2 ship /sea combat is amazing 3 pirates 4 general combat is it 's ok but the sneaking and hiding features are decent 5 the controls here 's where i have an issue frankly speaking you need to use a controller to get the most out of this game imo 'free-running' is the same as sprinting so unless you want to walk at a snail 's pace you 'll need to use that  to follow targets on the 'chase the theif etc missions  but the free -running part will always assume you want to climb a wall if you run into it by accident (which wastes your time meaning that your target gets away it 's pretty annoying but there 's nothing you can do about it as you have to run after your target not walk but overall it seems like a pretty good game though i 'd only recommend it if it 's on sale
['no topic'],https ://youtu.be/i8ju_10nkgy end me
"['uplay', 'errors']",uplay wouldn't load so i couldn't even play the game it doesn't make sense to have to go through both uplay and steam to even launch the game a poor decision on ubisoft's part
"['pirate theme', 'storyline']",since everyone has been telling me that sea of thieves is bad i needed to relieve my pirate urges through another game so i got this i just wanted to sail around and find treasure and be a funny little pirate and i did that and it was great but i didn 't expect that my favorite part would be the story i was immediately hooked into it haha get it like a pirate hook because pirates loose their hands in battle or from infection and need prosthetics but yeah the story was very good this games holds the second spot for games that made me cry at the end the other game being red dead redemption that game took place at the end of the cowboy era this game took place at the end of the pirate era i guess romanticizing criminals just makes for a touching story also play with subtitles on the game was based off of some old book that used old english and the subtitles are written in that style so it 's cool to see how some words are written and how they used punctuation
"['storyline', 'combat']",absolutely brilliant tops even assassin 's creed iii hours and hours of 'free world -experience'... and the naval battles are quite as well as the rest of the game definetely worth it
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'pirate theme']",well after spending over 40 hours on the game i have to say this is the best assassin 's creed since brotherhood you get right into the story and your character has a very strong charisma the ability to explore and do just about whatever you want is a nice change i trully enjoyed the naval battle and the concept of taking ships to add them to your fleet to complete missions is very nice i have not finished the game because i spent more time exploring the ship wrecks the islands stealing ships completing the templar hunt etc as i said many many things to do and so far i have not been bored of it lets not forget the other notorious pirates such black beard captain kidd rackam etc highly recommend this one
['no topic'],get the standard edition getting the perks from gold and deluxe is as reliable as a 1st -century man from syria with no limbs delivering a modern -day javelin to california by marching to south africa and going to the panama canal then he goes to tokyo and finally california plus there 's the weight of a javelin not to mention the 18th -century empires that are constantly after him with a 22nd -century tracker on him if you can 't trust that guy you can 't trust ubisoft with your dlc
"['storyline', 'combat']",the story was pretty good and the gameplay was fun excluding the trailing and eavesdropping shit they made you do .......in every fucking mission boat trailing are you kidding me fun game
"['uplay', 'errors']",it is super inconvinient that we have to download uplay for this game i havn 't been able to play the game since ****ing uplay is giving me probably wouldn 't have bought the game if i had known how much grief uplay is giving me sure the game is great if you can get it to work though
"['storyline', 'pirate theme']","i think the running around parts got if anything slightly worse tailing people is less interesting since blonde pirates have x -ray vision and aside from that there 's not much new to it other than grenades and more hiding spots however the game also introduces the whole sailing thingamabob which is the most actiony rendition of sailing a big hulking ship i 've ever seen story -wise, the pirate main character is quite different from the previous protagonists which is refreshing and fun but the present -day parts do a bad job at convincing me to be interested in the new impending apocalypse that desmond replaced the old one with at the end of the last game perhaps that 's why they stopped numbering them after this one because they too couldn 't be bothered to care about the modern -day plot any more"
['pirate theme'],changed the spoken language to japanese when i playing this game now i will find one piece and become pirate king seriously best game ever
['errors'],ubisoft broke the game with the latest patch
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'exploration']",good fucking game ubisoft i can be pirate assassin and adventurer 9 /10
['pirate theme'],i love pirate booty this game is awesome
"['combat', 'series']",in my eyes bets ac game fight me
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'storyline', 'assassin theme']",the most decent pirate game out there actually great naval combat and navigation the story is alright as well my favorite assassin 's creed so far
['no topic'],one of the best
"['combat', 'series', 'graphics']","this game is great they add new feature naval combat wich is fun than previous ac series ,graphic is awesome and game mechanic is good ,must have game"
"['no topic', 'series', 'uplay', 'customer support']",do not buy this game unless you don 't plan on playing the dlc if you do want to play with the dlc buy one of the deluxe editions that have everything bundled together an update fucked up dlc for almost everyone and you can 't play it if you buy the game then any dlc or the season pass otherwise it 's a great game best in the franchise before they switched to the style they are with now it 's a shame that ubisoft sucks so much willy and wont fix the issue they talk you in circles with ubisoft support about how they are 'fixing' and 'investigating' a 2 year old issue with a clear solution
['pirate theme'],yarr harr deedly dee dee you are a pirate
"['uplay', 'customer support']",this game was actually pretty fun but as of recent (not sure how recent ubiplay which is necessary to actually play the game requires 2 step verification through an authenticator app no matter what i try ubiplay does not want to communicate with the app (s) i have tried so it 's literally unplayable thanks to ubisoft 's drm policy trying for a refund though that 's unlikely and will soundly say i will never buy anything from ubisoft again in my life
['series'],probably the most classic ac game
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'exploration']","tl ;dr the game is great for it 's pirate aspect and for the assassin 's part .if you like pirates of the caribbean then you will love this one -best pirate game out there -great environment -nice gameplay (naval combat is great ,otherwise it 's a typically assassin 's creed minion kill simulator -good graphics -mediocre to bad story -blackbeard if the title was just ''black flag and not ''assassin's creed iv black flag then i wouldn 't be able to find any flaws in this one .the only assassin 's creed part is the characteristic gameplay of the franchise yet naval combat is something new and done extremelly well .the world is big big enough to spend hours and hours to explore ,you get the feeling of a real pirate and its most amusing .yes the storyline is quite dull and one -dimensional, the abstergo -animus thing has quite disappeard but the observatory and ''those who came before '' are present the great thing about it is that it delivers the feeling of the pirate setting 100 and of course blackbeard i would rate it blackbeard /10"
"['customer support', 'uplay']",before anything else i wholeheartedly recommend playing this game that being said i need to mention this and because of my experience i cannot recommend you purchasing this in the current way ubisoft the dumbasses they are expect you to i was robbed by ubisoft because of this as with pretty much all of ubisoft 's games you need an activation key to play this game because of their absolute dog ass uplay app i do not know how i do not know why there is no searches on any search engine that i could do to find anyone with a similar situation but the game after i had already played it for over two hours requested to see my activation key again so i found the key and activated the game again but i got the message 'this key was already used on another account note i got the game for like 20 bucks on sale or something you can imagine my confusion i had only ever used one uplay account and one steam account in my entire life so my solution was to go to refund the game i had not realized the price was raised since i had gotten it so i go to refund the game i think that 's going to be that and after i rebuy the game and get a new key that all will be well i go to the store page just to double check reviews and what do i find the game is double what i got it for this didn 't irk me much though i have twenty dollars to spend personally i don 't have money problems but it was frustrating steam denies my refund because 'you have surpassed the 48 hour refund time limit or some bullshit excuse like that in order to play this game that i would put in my top 10 of all time again i had to remove the game instance from my account not getting my money back at all mind you this game and it 's content is about a decade old and ubi has the audacity to sell it for 40 fucking dollars but as you saw above ubi isn 't the only company with bullshit practices here the game was rendered unplayable on my account and they didn 't show an ounce of proper support when i tried to get it (including the refund i was robbed steam and ubisoft had robbed me of forty dollars and all the progress i had made in the game it may not be directly but when a company is this negligent to it 's users that it actively strips the product it promised from you while keeping the money you spent for it yeah it 's a mother fucking problem to be honest i don 't care too much about the money i lost what i give a shit about is the principle the fact that this kind of thing is what companies get away with is outrageous and the fact that we all agree that the modern corporate model is absolutely fucking torturous for the common man and yet nothing has really been done to change that is sickening especially when it comes to the gaming industry because it is rampant here i am going to buy the game again this game is fucking amazing and edward is hot but unless you are confident that you wont run into this problem i have don 't buy it wait for ubisoft to change their moronic ways i 'd use a much harsher word if it wasn 't so offensive because ubi 's business practices are nothing short of harmful to the users i 'd say i expected better but ubisoft 's awful reputation precedes them and steam support has been at most pretty terrible to downright malicious in my experience at times simultaneously i 'd say i 'm not surprised but well this has never happened to me before in this level of catastrophic negligence that i can 't help but remain appalled grossly over -summarized conclusion steam and ubisoft robbed me of sixty dollars because the former can 't get a proper support system and the latter hires toddlers to program their shitty apps
['entertainment value'],10 /10 would plunder them booty again
['customer support'],i have spend the last 12 hours trying to activate the game on ubisoft but i keep getting an error they keep asking me for screenprints to be reassured that i own the game ubisoft is not helpful at all they just suggest irrelevant connectivity solutions if it 's up to them i should buy a new computer i am waiting for one last reply from them if it proves useless i will refund the game
['uplay'],stupid ubisoft launcher mandatory disgusting
"['storyline', 'uplay']",assassin 's creed was an amazing game until they removed access to your dlc that you paid for on 1 september 2022 this is fraud and we should be suing ubisoft for this blatantly illegal act
['series'],best ac game
"['storyline', 'series', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",bought this in steam summer sale and was so worth it it is my first ac game and it is amazing the story is great i never really liked the modern day part but the ending is worth it .the side quests are all right the reward is pretty good the mayan colectibles do not fell forced and getting them all is satisfiying .all in all a great game do your self a favor and buy it 9 /10
"['errors', 'uplay', 'customer support']",don't like -forcing me to create uplay account -first time i started the game it crashes -turns out that the game had crash issues for quite sometime now and the game still crashes -they don't reply to my support ticket so i am screwed and they get a big laugh with my money
"['series', 'pirate theme', 'uplay']",assassin 's creed 2 was the best game in the series i would say this is the 2nd best game in the series lots to do and fun pirate warfare the only negative thing about this game is ubicrap and the cancer uplay
"['full screen', 'uplay', 'customer support']",this is my first time playing black flag and i feel like i just got robbed i downloaded the game just after the new update thinking nothing of it and as i excitedly launch the game it just stays in windowed mode no solutions or anyway to be in fullscreen plus i can 't access kenway 's fleet it just stays in the loading screen forever this has been an issue to players for the past few months or so and no fleet means no 100 to the game ubisoft is just abstergo but worse
"['uplay', 'series']",dont get me wrong black flag is a fantastic game and one of my all time favorite of the ac series however the uplay service is a absolute garbage piece of unecessary launcher software you will be forced to create an account and even though you have entered and validated a product key you will need to login to this uplay account every single time you want to play hopefully you dont forget your password too and enter it wrong more than 5 times your account will be locked for 24 hours during that time you can reset your password but there is no way not even by contacting support that they will lift your account suspension ubisoft refuses to allow you to reverify the account within that period by any means so my 2 cents for you reading this is skip on the pc version of this maybe someday the morons at ubisoft will figure out a better way to implement anticheat and game validity as if its even remotely slowed anyone from pirating the game anyway
"['errors', 'series']",as of 12 december 2022 the game 's servers have been down for several days and it is not possible to complete the game approximately 20 of the way through the single -player campaign there is a mission that requires online connectivity that currently cannot be completed the game is good one of my favourite of the ac titles but as long as the ubisoft servers are down the game is effectively unplayable
['errors'],the game used to work but now has the well known acsp .exe has stopped working bug and will not launch no mather what you do i have went thru all the supposed solutions lost hours trying to get it to work people had this problem going back to 2013 and ubi did nothing to fix it if you are on windows 10 save your money and don 't buy it cause you have 80 chance that the game will not work edit a year later with a different pc and different win10 installation the games finally works to this day i don 't know what was the cause of the previous problem as i have tried all the solutions i found online the game it self if brilliant and fun to play even in 2022 wish i would know why i couldn 't previously get it to run
"['uplay', 'errors']",bought the game tried to sign in uplay connection to uplay server not possible tried to play offline you need to have an online connection to play this game decided to never buy any ubisoft game again f **k you ubisoft
"['uplay', 'series', 'customer support']",i would love to recommend the game but i never will and so long as uplay exists i will never buy another ubisoft game i have spend more time trying to get uplay to work than i have playing the game (and i 'm 12 finished with the single -player campaign the world is beautiful and the gameplay is fun but the game requires uplay which is a broken pile of steaming excrement according to ubimal uplay needs me to set static a static ip for my computer then set up port forwarding for *twenty-four* different ports and if my wife or i want to switch computers (we have two desktops and a laptop that can run ac4 on max settings then i have to go into the router configuration and change *all twenty -four* ports to forward to the *other* static ip and that 's *if* ubisoft connects i haven 't been able to connect yet i have 70 games in my steam library and i (semi-)regularly play five or more mmos i have a 200mbps connection (up and down that usually sees maximum latency with north american servers in the range of 100 -200ms. the only time i *ever* have trouble connecting to a game is when it requires u (don't)play. we almost bought two copies so we could play the multiplayer together (we normally just play mmos together i am so glad that i didn 't because buying the deluxe version of this game plus all of the dlc only to find that i can 't access anything but the basic single -player game is frustrating enough i would be highly irritated to have blown twice as much only to be locked out as it is i am strongly considering demanding a refund for everything except the basic game something i have *never* done in twenty years of pc gaming
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'movement', 'graphics', 'music']",and here we are with my favorite assassin ’s creed game assassin ’s creed iv black flag i wrote these reviews in advance and even though it ’s my absolute favorite it was the hardest to review because i so desperately want to make you see why i think this one ’s the best and most fun one yet so let ’s skip the story (as i already mentioned in the review for aciii and get to the good part the gameplay itself again this assassin ’s creed takes some of the elements of the previous games and expands on it no more tower defense types of activities and all that though no this time the naval combat gets all the attention and it works like a charm because instead of having separate lands like all of the previous games this time everything is open from the start it ’s a gigantic open world that begs to be explored while still having that same old assassin ’s creed feel shortly after starting the game you ’re dropped on a caribbean island and shortly after that you acquire you first ship one that can be upgraded with new and upgraded weapons and you can also equip it with cosmetic items after that you ’re free to go wherever you like there are tens of islands big and small that can be explored you ’ll find treasure maps animus fragments sea shanties actual treasure and more on these island and each island has their own set with objectives that be completed for 100 besides sailing and traveling on land you can also swim underwater (most of the times to find treasure as well as hunt animals and do almost all of the activities you would find in the other assassin ’s creed games besides navigating the ocean you will also find yourself in battle with other ships numerous times (and you can board these and fight on deck and you can also take down fortified bunkers from the waters that open fire on you when you come too close additional crew members can be acquired by doing bar fights and specific missions as you can see there ’s just plenty to do and it all works and controls great combat wise you can now freely aim your pistols and you can also dual -wield melee weapons stealth seems have been improved as well and seems to flow a bit better making things easier overall the issue of jumping off of things seems to still be there unfortunately that together with the modern segments (these are somewhat tolerable now are the only downsides i can think of this is still one of the more beautiful assassin ’s creed games with tropical thunders and above all a (mostly amazing sunny atmosphere that will remind one of summer it really is a great game to play during the summer the faces of the characters are a little less pretty even with the improvements they made the voice acting is nothing short of amazing and the music is sweeping the sea shanties are a fun idea that add to the general atmosphere as well i hope to have let you seen (read) why i think this one ’s the best there ’s just so much to do but in my opinion not to the point that you ’re swamped in icons like the later games the atmosphere makes it one of the more enjoyable experiences and the gameplay (minus jumping works in harmony with all of the (newly) added elements nothing feels like it doesn ’t belong bravo ubisoft if you enjoyed this review please consider following me curator page 
"['entertainment value', 'stealth', 'movement', 'uplay']",i 've played over 300 hours of this on console i can definitely say it 's one of the most immersive experiences i 've ever had in a video game familiarize yourself with the controls turn off the hud and enjoy pretty much the closest version to a childhood pirate fantasy you can experience in a video game btw install uplay on uplay 's website not the version steam gives you (it's outdated
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",inside animus for one moment you are an assassin for the next you are a pirate and then you assassinate the assassins and pirate the privateers outside animus for one moment you are an employee for the next you are a hacker and then you test your animus and hack the heck out of abstergo 10 /10.
['no topic'],my first ac game and oh boy is it great very good first impression
"['pirate theme', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'entertainment value']",absolutely amazing this has to be the best game of the series the graphics are fantastic the feeling this game gives you when sailing the seas with your crew singing shanties is mind blowing i have never been into shanties but i still listen to the songs from the game months after playing 10 /10 would play again
['uplay'],will not let you play without installing the garbage that is ubisoft connect here 's a tip for publishers your consumers do not want your bloated crapware launcher it adds zero value to the game and just alienates your userbase by making getting to the actual game take longer than needed please just stop you lost the marketplace wars get over it and fire the mba holders telling you otherwise
"['optimization', 'pirate theme']",i am torn on whether to recommend this game the reason for this is because i love the game itself but it is just so poorly optimised the game itself is incredably fun and i love pretending to be a pirate plus as a history buff seeing people like edward thatch (aka blackbeard make me nerd out a bit on the other hand it is a uplay game i could barely get my game to run at 30 fps and had several bad glitches so i am going to go ahead and recomend this game for its sake but just be prepared to deal with uplay
"['series', 'storyline', 'entertainment value']","this is my favorite game in the series .i heard that the reviews about the game were bad ,so i entered the game with low expectations ,but i liked this game"
"['pirate theme', 'storyline']",assassins creed or not solid game with a fantastic world to sail across with many an island to plunder looks good plays good and tells a good few stories along the way dream game for pirate lovers
"['gameplay', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'music']",gameplay 7 /10 story 10 /10 graphics 8 /10 sound /music 8 /10 variety 9 /10 fun 9 /10 overall 8 .5/10
"['pirate theme', 'storyline']",this is it this is the best one i 've played you can just sail around pirating any time you get bored of doing the missions and the crew know no shortage of shanties it might be an older game but it 's still worth playing
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",best assassins game i played from this series you play as a pirat and you are a pirate graphic sound an gameplay are one of the best enter ships fight agains enemy kill kings go fish a shark or play online with frends tune your ship to make it stronger steal rum or sugger and sell it for money to buy upgrates this game makes a lot of fun
"['storyline', 'uplay']",i do recommend the game but i also advise ubisoft to kill uplay  many people give the game a negative review because they lost their savegame well same happened to me storyline finished only some stuff to collect left in singleplayer multiplayerlevel quite progressed one day starting the game finding no savegame googling what could have happened uplay happened looks like when there is any problem while the game is syncing or loading the savefile via uplay it 's gone after weeks of beeing just pissed off at ubisoft i gave it one more try and made it a 100 (like i did with all other ac titles it is a great game worth the money story graphics action many additional places to go besides the main story uplay it is an unnecessary piece of software noones likes it noone needs it dear ubisoft finally listen to your customers and get rid of this piece of junk software .
"['storyline', 'character', 'combat', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'optimization']",this review along with other reviews from the steam community can also be found at the new group http ://steamcommunity.com/groups/reviewboard assassins creed 4 black flag restored a little fate in the assassin 's creed line after the (spoiler for the assassin 's creed 3  the death of desmond miles but for me this was devastating  and the horrible character of ratonhnhaké :ton a .k.a. connor but our newest unknown main character a research assistant for abstergo entertainment seems to have some unknown potential but enough about him our true main character edward kenway a man who wanted to hold the world hostage and take what was owed to him or so he thought and became a pirate and lived by the pirate code and unwittingly lived by the iconic assassin 's code nothing is true everything is permitted edward does start off a little lackluster and takes you awhile to get into his character and the many flaws he does have (spoiler)  not being a true assassin or even joining order at the end of the game i knew he had joined at the end but felt like it wasn 't a strong revelation for him to join  the story was strong in spots and weak in others and felt a little jumpy from certain missions to the next mission towards the end of the game they mentioned its been six years and you are like wow really one of the downsides of the game is how ubisofts loves adding those treasure chest and the run after an item like almanac sheets in the third and now music sheets and animus fragments i personally am bored with because all the games have had something along these lines but the plus side no feathers in this game same way with the fighting mechanics you basically just spam the same button combinations over and over eventually i would like to see a combo fighting style installed in the games to keep it fresh the open world /sea was a amazing you will spend hours raiding ships till the awe factor wears off and i mean hours because it was fantastic and the world was so huge if you didn 't have the fast travel it would take you days (over exaggeration to get from one location to another the naval part was one of the prizewinning features of this video game it was grand legendary ship battles will have you shouting for joy once you defeat these monstrous ships now the other downside to assassin 's creed black flag was the every so often how you would find the hole in the world and just free falling to your death the climb your ship from the sea and just fall through and be stuck or the gaming loading and you and your crew fall in a big empty ocean where your ship should be and the occasional graphic glitch where you need to exit the game completely and start again these were more annoying then anything on just how random they were all and all ac4 black flag was a excellent game and as a huge fan of the series i do recommend this game even though the gameplay and style hasn 't changed much since brotherhood http ://steamcommunity.com/groups/reviewboard
"['no topic', 'pirate theme']",warning the gold edition content does not work with uconnect even though you bought it on steam with that said this is by far the best pirate game ever made you have to play it for yourself in order to understand why this game is kick ass so many years later
['no topic'],warning warning_ do not buy this game from steam only buy it through ubisoft the cd keys you get here will not be able to be redeemed due to an issue that has persisted for over a year if you want black flag your chance is only through ubisoft play due to automatic activation

"['errors', 'customer support']",bought it today and the activation code is invalid ubisoft support says 'its a known issue and we 're looking to resolve it instead of just giving you a working key like they should dont waste your money on this scam
"['combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'stealth', 'music']",the good : highly -refined combat system well -balanced and non -gimmicky sailing system huge meticulously -made open world with few duplicate textures potential for extremely good graphics if you have the hardware good sound and voice acting environment interaction is top -notch missions are designed well and have a large variety stealth is fun challenging and diverse memorable soundtrack stunning visuals the bad : no triple buffering uplay with its malevolent updates and other skullduggery hud is tacky distracting and too intrusive combat is too easy and unchallenging (stealth makes up for this some aspects are copied from previous games without improvement glitches of titanic proportions (excuse the pun kenway 's fleet minigame thing is horrible too many cutscenes especially when doing sailing activities bottom line : the most refined and diverse assassin 's creed yet however if ubisoft keeps improving each game in small increments and releasing every year or so this series will turn stale very soon (this has already happened according to some until then this game is well -polished and extensive and thus highly recommended
['pirate theme'],wanna be a pirate buy this game :d
"['storyline', 'entertainment value']",amazing game one of the best campaign ever addictive to 100 complete 9 .5/10 recommend without doubt more reviews at https ://store.steampowered.com/curator/35698420/
['pirate theme'],i love sea shanties
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'combat', 'assassin theme', 'exploration', 'character', 'series', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'music']",there is a lot to say about assassin 's creed iv black flag you have a vast open world in which you can travel by foot or by sea you can either be stealth or brutal in your tactics you can be the devil of the seven seas or a vigilante of the nations and inspire freedom to your crew the graphics are absolutely amazing i 've always admired water textures in video games and other than skyrim this has been the best i 've seen by far the sails of the ships and the gusts of wind that push them across the watery abyss the environmental hazards of the sea rouge waves and cyclones that rip apart everything in its path the smallest island to the largest populated city this game has a realistic and unique quality the gameplay is excellent the pirate story line is something that someone can only imagine sure they have movies other pirate games etc but i never have felt the true pirate experience the assassin edward kenway is an amazing addition to the creed line the battles on land are just as expected as an assassin 's creed game but with new tools outfits and other additions the ship battles are an amazing feature there 's a lot you can choose from to fix it up how you like some of the things you love must be found or conquered to be added upon your ship the present day story line was rather interesting some of it made sense and the rest of it did not it 's pretty expected to be confused about it because you have no idea who you 're character is sample 17 is the bloodline from subject 17 so as far as it is concerned the character you are in control of does not have any connection to the bloodline you are just going back into subject 17 's ancestral line hopefully something will have mention in unity 's present day the mulitplayer i couldn 't really get into i think it 's fun to play with other people but i don 't think they have mastered this quality in their industry yet they still have some things they need to work on for multiplayer that will appeal and increase their community and fanbase with unity on its way i do believe co -op is their greatest option for the moment until they can figure out what to fix in their multiplayer services all in all best assassin 's creed since altair 5 /5 singleplayer 2 /5 online experience
"['errors', 'cloud mechanics']",the game itself is great but i cannot recommend it due to one major infuriating flaw cloud saving is broken and the game will at some point randomly corrupt your save file forcing you to start from the beginning it 's happened to me three times and it makes me not want to play the game what 's worse is that the location of the save file on your pc it 's not easy to find so that you can back it up after all the time i spent grinding to get to the level i was at it infuriates me when i think but i have to do it all over again and that makes me not want to play ubisoft is no help steam is no help when not if your save file becomes corrupted you will just be sol
['no topic'],ubisoft servers are shut down there is no way to activate the game anymore dont waste money and time on a broken game
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'assassin theme']",sea battle is super fun never get tired of redemption sort of story best pirate game so far my second favorite assassin ’s creed (the first is revelation and the most enjoyable one
"['assassin theme', 'errors']",black flag 's great one of the better assassin 's creed games my favourite part is when the ubi -trash connect launcher crashed 15 times before finally letting me enter the cd key so i could play the game
"['no topic', 'errors', 'uplay']",this game is a bloody masterpiece i mean it hands down one of the most fun games i 've played in my life it 's a shame i cannot play it anymore a recent update completely broke the ubisoft launcher and now this 10 -year-old game doesn 't start anymore if steam fixes this i will delete this review and post a positive one until then don 't buy a product that doesn 't work
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'graphics']",the best pirate game ever one of the best assassins creed ever great graphics great gameplay the collect &upgrade feature is great the only thing that sucks is all the tailing missions but still its a must play 9 /10
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",assassin 's creed black flag is probably the best assasin 's creed game that there is the combat is the the fun bloody skilled fighting you 've gotten used to through the previous games but with new weapons and gadgets to help make the experience fresh and updated the story 's ok i mean its an assasin 's creed game they basically all have the same campaign but with a different reskin each time but hey that 's not why you 're here you 're here for the boats probably the best thing ever to happen to the assasin 's creed franchise they made the entire game around the new extremely fun mechanic of boating and pirating the exploration and raiding you 'll do out on the open seas will keep you excited and busy for hours while also being intertwined with the story this is what made this game better than all the others so many people loved this part of the game so much it just has to be a part of the newer games r -right guys they wouldn 't risk taking it away from the newer ones
"['series', 'pirate theme']",a great addition to the flagship series which also happens to be the best pirate game ever made
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'movement']","what in davy jones locker did ye just bark at me ye scurvy bilgerat i ’ll have ye know i be the meanest cutthroat on the seven seas and i ’ve led numerous raids on fishing villages and raped over 300 wenches i be trained in hit -and-run pillaging and be the deadliest with a pistol of all the captains on the high seas ye be nothing to me but another source o swag i ’ll have yer guts for garters and keel haul ye like never been done before hear me true you think ye can hide behind your newfangled computing device think twice on that scallywag as we parley i be contacting my secret network o pirates across the sea and yer port is being tracked right now so ye better prepare for the typhoon weevil the kind o monsoon that ’ll wipe ye off the map you ’re sharkbait fool i can sail anywhere in any waters and can kill ye in o ’er seven hundred ways and that be just with me hook and fist not only do i be top o the line with a cutlass but i have an entire pirate fleet at my beck and call and i ’ll damned sure use it all to wipe yer arse off o the world ye dog if only ye had had the foresight to know what devilish wrath your jibe was about to incur ye might have belayed the comment but ye couldn ’t, ye didn ’t, and now ye ’ll pay the ultimate toll you buffoon i ’ll shit fury all over ye and ye ’ll drown in the depths o it you ’re fish food now"

"['uplay', 'errors']",ubisoft connect asks to enter password every time i am trying to launch the game
"['pirate theme', 'storyline']",very amazing pirate game and the best pirate game so far unfortunately this game doesn't have an online open world but the singleplayer is open world and has a very good story campaign the multiplayer in this game sucks because it's not open world and there is no naval gameplay other than that this is the best f *cking pirate game ever totally recommend it for the awesome adventure
"['no topic', 'uplay', 'full screen']",ubisoft is a garbage company thanks for the latest update that forces windowed mode and no way to turn it off also the constant logins to ubisoft connect like anyone cares good game if ubisoft would get out of their own way
"['series', 'character', 'exploration', 'stealth']",having played all ac games and having spent about 300 hours in doing so i can say without doubt that this one is the most fun intriging and exciting above all removed from the morality issues of ezio and all his baggage and the monotony and boredom of connor black flag gives us edward a small man with big aspirations not being bogged down with the weight of the assassins from day 1 is a refreshing change of pace and the freedom to hit the seas and have a crack at who ever and whatever crosses your path is great hitting locations simply for the hell of it is great also i spent the first 30 hours just sailing about picking stuff up going to islands and boarding ships also the stealth thing is back acbf makes you think about attack plans whilst trying to assault a castle or takedown a target no more running headlong into a target hitting him hard then diving into the sea ......no no you need your thinking caps and paitience all in all i have enjoyed this greatly and the plot although not quite so grand is facinating and you feel that you could leave it to explore without making it feel unimportant only downside is the whole animus thing being kicked from your pirate adventures to walk about an office for the 'actual' story is frustrating and i feel that the ac games suffer from that but all in all brilliant
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'graphics']",best ac game to date imo more like a pirate simluator based in the early 1700s in the caribbean that uses ac combat sick graphics and environments
"['graphics', 'combat', 'storyline', 'errors', 'series']",amazing graphics amazing gameplay amazing story a great game appart from the odd bug here and there but they cause little problems 9 /10. a must buy if you like the idea of an open world assassin / pirate game stunning
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'combat', 'character', 'series', 'graphics', 'uplay', 'entertainment value']",i have been playing assassins creed 4 for 11 hours now and here is what i have to say about the single player campaign the game is a 3rd person action adventure game just like the previous three before it developed by ubisoft montreal and published by ubisoft assassins creed 4 has surprised me with how the game starts off it begins with a good build up to your character and then you find yourself beached on a shore with a fellow sailor and then chasing after him when i first started playing the game i was very surprised on how it started off with pirating and adventuring after a bit of playing the game started to feel like assassins creed with the climbing up a tall tower to sync you to your surroundings eventually i got to get my own ship and sail the seas finding small little islands and other larger islands to explore for treasure chests messages in bottles and treasure maps you also get to chase after sea chanty songs for your crew to sing as your sailing other artifacts like aztec monuments you climb and get to orientate a marker with your surrounding to find where the buried artifact will be is a cool idea in the game this all makes this game a joy to play and a break away form the old flag hunting that is meaningless the game play is the same as previous assassin creed games with the climbing and combat style i like that you can run up to a person and assassinate them get into tavern fights to open the tavern up to you there are places in town when you first begin where you need to save some pirates from the authorities who later join you and are your crew on ship you also get to save people adrift on the seas and they become crew members once you upgrade your ship to include harpoons you will be able to go whaling and get that big white whale along with whaling you can go shark hunting as well eventually you will get to a point in the game where you will get control of your own island and call it home upgrading it to provide a tavern shop ship repair store and an estate home as well this game was played with an xbox360 controller and i can say that its really made to accommodate this type of game play i appreciate it when developers make a game compatible with a controller i am very impressed with assassins creed iv black flag and happy that i picked up the deluxe gold edition for $30 during the 2014 summer sale if your planning to buy this game or not sure if you want to play another assassins creed game i would recommend this game check out the video below assassins creed 4 is worth a play i give this game : ːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː pros:  open world ship battles pirating! great story lots of side quests treasure hunting  cons:  the animus chasing down sea chanty tunes before it resets camera angle changes when picking up a body to hide it making it difficult to orientate yourself  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzdhkaavqgq
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'combat', 'series', 'entertainment value']",assassin 's creed 4 one of ubisoft 's flagship titles already named ps4 's game of the year does not disappoint a lot of bang for your buck here epic storyline with fleshed out cities and islands to explore plenty of loot to plunder and enemy ships to battle if that isn 't enough add in a epic story following the adventures of a young edward kenway and you have a great game ac4 also includes a fully blown multiplayer game both pvp and co -op wolfpack modes 9 /10
"['errors', 'uplay']",this buggy piece of garbage got my whole uplay account banned the multiplayer portion of ac4 crashes on startup as i was trying to troubleshoot i tried launching the multiplayer a few times with different compatibility settings after a few attempts i was met with a uplay message that i was 'temporarily suspended for multiple failed logins attempts even though i was logged into uplay the whole time no idea how long 'temporarily' is but as of writing this i 'm still banned absolutely do not purchase if you want to play the multiplayer at all or risk losing access to all your ubisoft games trying to get it to work the developers have the foresight of a toddler playing chess edit after getting unbanned and getting it to work after disabling nvidia overlay i got banned again

"['errors', 'uplay']",cant play because ubisoft connect forgot my password now i cant play the game that i bought and account got suspended from to many attempts
"['series', 'uplay', 'cloud mechanics', 'assassin theme', 'series']",great game .....but one problem ......lost my save file ......i thought well it 's saved in the cloud no big issue but no its not it turns out that uplay stopped cloud saving support of assassin 's creed iv black flag .....which made me real mad .....i got more than half way through the game and i have to say it is very decent in my opinion not the best out of the series but defenitly not the worst i guess i 'll have to replay all the mission and re -ugrade the jackdaw which will be a pain in the ass but willing to do it considering i am a huge fan of the series just remember to back up your save file
"['pirate theme', 'graphics', 'stealth']",i have poured hours of gameplay into this game and feel like there is still so much to do long games that are of a good quality are rare to find nowadays assassins creed 4 is a master in stealing your time once you take the helm upon your trusted vessel and throw caution to the wind as you and your band of pirates sail plunder and drink your way through a gorgeous virtual recreation of the caribbean the graphics are gorgeous on the highest settings and the world never fails to completely immerse you every time you decide to captain the jackdaw the ship and ground sections are like playing two different games but they cross -over seamlessly as you can see when boarding another ship the free -running is also much improved but it still suffers from being a bit imprecise at times the underwater segments are amazing and thrilling a mix of treasure hunting and stealth parts
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'character', 'optimization', 'combat', 'exploration', 'series', 'customer support']","assassins creed iv black flag  black flag as title says it is prequel of assassins creed iii first of all ...so you really need to play first ac iii to understand connection outside of animus but no spoilers i like the huge open world it is really dynamic and huge for 2013 game the graphic does age well to nowdays standards i like specially main character edward he is really adorable pirate  pros  huge open world sailing on your ship (well you are true pirate amazing storyline great dlc freedom cry amazing side characters not bad side activites across the world pirate ship battles (really fun many outfits customization of ship  cons  few bugs can be odd sometimes time to time bad optimization (lags, even i have high end gaming pc lol some activities are repetitive i wish story is longer in total as result the game is worth the full price but if you are on budget wait for huge discount there is many per year for older assassin 's creed games my total review is 8 ,9/10!

['pirate theme'],yaaaaarrrrrrrrr me hearties tis a game about being a pirate take to the seas plunder all in sight and drink rum til you 're sick yo ho ho
['series'],i loved what ubisoft made out of ac franchise this game deserves people to play
"['full screen', 'windowed mode']",new patch removes the full screen and forces you to play in windowed mode and any borderless windowed program freezes the game do not get it
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'music']",honestly this is the best game in the series for me it has so much heart the world is incredible sure the game has aged now but the shanties are as a joy to listen to now as they were all those years ago when it comes to the game don 't leave her johnny
"['errors', 'uplay']",do not purchase there is a server side issue with being able to redeem your cd key through ubisoft the issue has been around sine june and ubisoft has no provided an update or a fix for the issue if you purchase this game you will not be able to play it until you can activate your key through uplay unreal that you can pay money for a game and have zero ability to play it due to an issue with a aaa companies launcher
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",amazing game i thoroughly enjoyed it i certain liked the aspect that you are first person when you 're the gamer but once you 're in the game you 're in third person aspect i enjoyed the plot too incredible graphics too i really enjoyed this game
"['storyline', 'graphics']",8 hours in completed all objectives and contracts in havanah nassau and like 4 raindom nearby islands and a plantation so far the game is just as good as i remember from xbox but with even better graphics
"['entertainment value', 'combat', 'graphics', 'assassin theme', 'animals', 'exploration']","very fun game replayability isn 't like an endless world game but you 'll get entertainment worth well over what you paid (see my 70+ hours i even bought the season pass because the game was so much fun the detail that was put into ac4 :bf is incredible the combat abilities are extremely fun especially once you 've unlocked all of them disarm an enemy and use his bayoneted gun to stab and blast him in the gut with a finisher oooooh yeeeaaahhhh ! on top of your pirate /assassin abilities you can hunt animals (incl. whales /sharks!), go diving for treasure control a fleet of ships that will bring in lots of and even play minigames like checkers nine men 's morris and fanorona"
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'graphics']",piratas ron barcos y muchas trolitas lo mejor que le paso a la saga despues del 2 la historia se deja llevar ya que los personajes estan muy bien hechos y no son un bodrio nuestro personaje es re copado y se la da de winner con las minitas el gameplay es muy divertido el mapa es enorme y cargado de cosas para hacer el juego engancha posta y facilmente te puede dar muchas horas sin darte cuenta cazar pescar nadar en el fondo del mar solo algunas de las tares del juego los graficos son increibles se ve y se siente que estas en el propio caribe el sonido es increible y las canciones cuando vas en el barco es lo mejor dlc 1 un negro macho alfa que todos lo quiere hacer cagar por ser negro con una historia que se sigue bastante bien dlc 2 una minita que hace un encargo de connor (ac3) dura una hora pero es bastante entretenido no tengo mas nada que decir solo anda a jugarlo forro

"['full screen', 'graphics']",the new update that came out a day or two ago for this game has removed fullscreen from the game on paper this is a minor issue but there is no option to change it back and it performs very poorly on 4k resolutions which because its now in windowed only means that you can only play in lower resolutions on 1 /4 of the screen or deal with how much it stutters on 4k even with rock bottom graphic settings but at least it isn 't a 1 /4 the size of the screen you 're playing on hoping they fix this sometime soon since this was my first time playing this game and i still have much more to go
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'graphics', 'combat', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'series', 'customer support']",after 41 hours of playing this game i reached the end i must say after playing through this game i did not only feel empty (what do i do with my life now lol but also sad i played all previous assassin 's creeds and this one is different not just the graphics the story and protagonist have changed but also the way you play this game in and the kind of character the protagonist has first of all you will play primarily on the sea there also is land but the sea is so much more open and in my opinion a lot better than in assassins creed 3 the things that make sailing so amazing are seafights songs (personal favorite drunken sailor that special feeling of sinking your first man o war and much more you 'll see thing english royal navy fighting against spanish ships huge seabattles will unfold and you will be enemy and plunderer of all you 'll capture seafortresses which will after capture not only stop attacking you but also start to attack british and spanish ships the story was once again amazing you start as edward kenway (yes you heard it right kenway a pirate that cares for nothing and no one and left his wife in britain to make some money as a privateer instead he stays as a pirate you will meet the likes of blackbeard and kidd along the story kenway turns into a man with honour and a moral code a true assassin i have nothing bad too say about this game in this 41 hours of gameplay no notable errors occured except for that one time that a ship spawned on me and i could not escape under it which was fixed easily by leaving the animus and re -entering. my system definetely is not the newest (4 gb ram a not so new graphics card etc but for most of the timne the game ran between 50 and 60 fps (i've had some drops to 30 fps though even some to 12 but that was so short that it didn 't really matter or f up the gameplay i bought this game for under €10 during the steamsale with the freedom cry dlc this game was definetly worth it for that price i 'd advise anyone who reads this to wait for a sale before buying this assassin 's creed games are on sale quite often every year ~my first review on steam
['errors'],can 't even launch the game always crashes just wonder how to fit it
"['uplay', 'customer support']",purchasing black flag on steam requires you to activate on ubisoft connect drm this has not been possible for a few months because ubisoft connect is not allowing new players to activate the game via cd key purchased from steam and there does not seem to be any fix incoming from ubisoft support this game is well worth the price especially on sale but should not be purchased from steam update shortly after writing this review the issue seems to be resolved however due to the lack of response from support and the time it took to fix i 'd still recommend purchasing this game directly through ubisoft
"['uplay', 'customer support']",great game but comes whit uplay a shitty piece of crap that no longer let me save the game and after 10 hours of playing i will just say go fuck you ubisoft not gonna buy any other game of yours until you remove uplay plataform
"['entertainment value', 'pirate theme']",i would give this 4 .5 stars out of 5 it 's an incredibly fun and unique game that feels immersive especially on the sea there 's lots of fun side activities like shark and whale hunting playing board games diving etc my only cons are that i had to grind for money and materials a lot of the islands looked the same and there 's some random fixed camera angles during some missions that are just awful i am so glad i played this game and i genuinely would recommend it to everyone you 'll never know how fun it is to be a pirate if you don 't play
"['storyline', 'music', 'series']",many people have described black flag as the worst assassin 's creed game ever made while still being the best pirate game they 've ever played that 's not entirely false but i bet most of those people never tried assassinating their target with a cannon my favorite aspect of the game by far is the music from the main theme and the battle music to the diegetic tunes of sea shanties and tavern singers i believe this game does music better than any other assassins creed so far and that 's no small accomplishment the tailing missions however drag this game 's prestige down considerably there are far too many of them here and not enough reasons to justify their existence in the second game they were sparse to the point and served a purpose in the plot but here they seem like nothing more than an excuse to move the plot forward it 's therefore ironic that my favorite mission in the game is in fact a tailing mission the 'siege of charles -towne' mission in the swamp was quite fun to play and i thoroughly enjoyed its dynamic nature assassin 's creed is a series that can lend itself to a multitude of scenarios and as sad as it makes me to say this i believe they captured lightning in a bottle with black flag that impression is only made stronger by unity which wasn 't nearly as fun to play as this one and the announcement of skull bones drives this point home for me because of course they were going to make that game you don 't make a game as successful and loved as black flag with such a reproducible formula and not capitalize on it going forward with a pirate game franchise based on the sailing aspect of black flag would be the equivalent of printing money
"['combat', 'storyline']",i have never ever had so much fun with any game i have ever played the combat system and controls on land and sea are superb on keyboard every thing looks gorgeous and the story line leaves you begging for more even with such a satisfying ending
['no topic'],selling an game that cant be started cuz the keys you get for ubisoft connect doesnt work anymore should be ilegal ubisoft gave up on steam issues support and doesnt do shit if you wanna get scammed then buy this game and get nothing in return edit it worked after like 1 week this seems to be very random so i recommend dont buy this game on steam
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'music', 'gameplay', 'bugs', 'combat', 'series']",difficulty  my 90 year old grandma could play it  easy  normal  hard  dark souls graphics  ms paint  bad  meh  graphics dont matter in this game  good  beautiful music  bad  not special  good  eargasm story  this game has no story  like playing temple runners for the story  it 's there for the people who want it  well written  epic story price  free  underpriced  perfect price  could be cheaper  overpriced  complete waste of money requirements  you can run it on a microwave  average  high end  nasa computer length  very short (0 3 hours  short (3 15 hours  average (15-50 hours  long (50-90 hours  extremely long (90-110 hours  no ending fun  i 'd rather watch paint dry  hard to enjoy  repetitive  actually pretty amusing  ride of your life replayability  it 's a one -time experience  only for achievements  if you wait a few months /years  definitely  infinitely replayable worth buying  no  wait for sale  yes assassin 's creed iv black flag is one of the best in the series even though the creed doesn 't play a major part until the end its fun engaging and most of all has a really enjoyable story you play as pirate captain kenway in the caribbean set years before the events of assassins creed iii witnessing kenways slow change of hearts and the growing constant conflict within him makes him a much better character compared to connor and even ezio who needed 3 whole games for his development the gameplay is really good but buggy sometimes the graphics are nice the story is amazing and the music is always perfect for every moment gameplay is smooth and fast with some performance issues here and there the main problem is that sometimes the engine cant handle climbing on moving objects and glitches often leaving you under the map or somewhere completely different ragdolling for no reason also happens quite frequently but is generally much better than the last game graphics are good and even beautiful in some areas but some strange effects happened in close ups and water on characters makes them look like they are made of plastic some of the beaches also have terrible lighting making the beach look bizarre however these were very small cases and you will mostly never see these issues the story is a well crafted thoroughly thought out masterpiece that really deserves more praise you witness a mans slow decent into a realisation that his dreams can never be a reality but his only option is to cling to every last bit until even that fails him in the end you end up with the people you hurt the most but they were also the ones willing to help you the most as you finally start to set things right with a lot of ship battles in between the music is great a fitting track for every moment and making each city come alive with its own unique sound overall assassins creed iv black flag corrects the mistakes ubisoft made in assassins creed iii but kept all the best parts of it ship battles are very cool and are extremely satisfying and are probably the best part of the game even if they are a bit repetitive kenways fleet is also very easy and fun to do an easy way to make lots of money a very good game assassin 's creed iv black flag gets a 9 /10. for more reviews check my steam profile hope you enjoyed my review god bless you
"['exploration', 'optimization', 'graphics', 'combat', 'series', 'customer support']","after 100 hours on this game ...i decided to give a review you can do so much besides the missions you can explore ,hunt,loot,destroy ships and more upgrading my ship was fun and awesome and it did not even get bored to upgrade my ship to prepare for what 's next however this game is a new start and kinda different from others assassin 's creed game but the game is awesome and there some glitches that does not ruin the game the glitches make this game funny but it does not ruin the game for you there is 2 outfits in the game where you could unlock you don 't even have to buy a dlc or anything that has to do with buying in order to open it there is a templar outfit -you have to collect all templar keys to open the outfit and there is a mayan outfit -collect all the mayan stones to unlock it ...it's worth it and if you get shot there will be no health taken away from you it 's damn sure recommend if you hate to use the human shield or getting shot every single time there is new items that is soooooooooooo useful in this game to help you out threw the gameplay assassin 's creed iv black flag freedom cry dlc the dlc is really short and you can beat it like in couple hours depends on how you play but when the dlc goes on sale ...it's worth for like $5.00 to spend couple hours and try beating the dlc i am getting ready for assassin 's creed unity are you ready for unity"
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'series', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",at first i 'd like to mention that i only played the first game for a couple of hours therefore i don 't have any knowledge or experience with any other assassin 's creed game . the story was nothing special but not necessarily bad it 's just like any other pirate movie with a goal to find the treasure it had many interesting characters especially in the beginning on the other hand i strongly disliked every single one of those abstergo office walking simulator parts who thought it was a good idea to bring that in gameplay is fantastic it 's full of naval battles stealth chasing eavesdropping exploring collecting etc . combat system is almost identical to shadow of mordor mad max and batman games there 's a reasonable amount of weapons for various situations hidden blades swords pistols blowpipes darts ropes smoke bombs and so on it just leaves you with a choice to either sneak around and assassinate your target or just jump right into the brawl against the whole crew besides fighting you 're free to complete challenges and side missions hunt explore cities ruins jungles or deserted islands while freely moving around the obstacles sailing that 's where the game shines the most being an open world game black flag let 's you freely travel through the sea and engage in naval combat since you 're the captain of your ship you 're able to fortify it some of those upgrades are cosmetic others are mostly weapons armor and space expanders your weapon arsenal while on the ship consists of mortars fire barrels swivel guns chain shots broadside and chase cannons heavy shots and a ram you can attack any ship that isn 't an ally of course you should evaluate its strength first as you won 't be easily taking down man o wars and legendary ships early in the game once the ship is weakened you may board it or sink it and take its loot other activities involving ships are harpoon fishing diving and developing your own fleet which carries and trades your goods with other countries i can 't say much about the multiplayer since i played it just for a few hours it seemed fun in certain modes but kind of confusing for a newcomer like me plus i really enjoyed the variety in skills wide customization and character models pros:  open world  a lot of stuff to do (side missions collectables etc  excellent ground and naval combat  freerunning  decent upgrades  perfect music   beautiful graphics  fun multiplayer  your own fleet simulation  storms /tornadoes/strong winds and waves  sea shanties cons: 'meh' story  kinda repetitive  can 't change your ship  uplay is necessary to play  poor optimization  no captain jack sparrow black flag attracted my attention due to ships mostly because i am a fan of pirates of the caribbean i had high expectations and they were fulfilled i 'd recommend getting this on sale 8/10
['uplay'],ubisoft connect is a cancer
"['frame rate', 'full screen', 'optimization', 'uplay']",the game is locked to 60 fps with stutters that go below 40 it launches in windowed mode and there is no way to go fullscreen in settings and as soon as i started the game i was met with levitating crew and than got soft -locked when i tried to sail the ship from what i read most of these problems are caused by the new game patch only ubisoft can completely out of nowhere fuck up a game that 's already been out for 10 years
"['errors', 'uplay', 'full screen']",well i brought this and had to immedaitely get a refund the games simply doesn 't work fullscreen thanks to some patch made by ubisoft years after it was released completely unplayable
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",best assassins creed game probably the best single player pirate game (let me know if yah got a better one
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'assassin theme', 'character', 'pirate theme', 'exploration', 'stealth']",after being mildly disappointed with ac 3 i am pleasantly surprised by this title the story line might not be the best in the assassins creed series but that is made up for through a tight atmosphere interesting characters and of course pirates who doesn 't like pirates the graphics are well executed game play and controls are on par with similar titles in game actions besides the main mission are varied reaching from harpooning and hunting through stealth looting of plantations to the ever popular collectibles which by the way include shanties that will be sung by the crew while at sea after unlocking overall the game is extremely captivating more so than it 's direct predecessor ac 3 there is multi of course which is a bit different from previous and it is well executed .well done ubisoft
['storyline'],brilliant story line very engaging and addictive althought the side missions can get very repetitive
"['uplay', 'errors']",dear who consider to purchase this game this game is unable to start playing now the game require to register game key to uplay but the uplay server is unavailable i tried two times and gave up i hope somebody else won 't have the same issue
"['graphics', 'gameplay', 'soundtrack', 'story', 'pirate theme', 'character', 'stealth']",9 /10 graphics 10 /10 gameplay 8 /10 soundtrack 9 /10 story 8 /10 never been a fan of the assassins creed franchise always thought it was over rated with clunky controls ac4 black flag has changed my opinion the gameplay is improved yet the stealth gameplay is still not great imo the game really shines in the pirating they have taken the best elements of character progression from far cry 3 excellent ship battles and places to conquer in fact it is such an improvement over the last games they could really have released this under a different franchise name runs well too no crashes for me 1600p with msaa this game looks sweet seriously buy it
['no topic'],masterpiece
"['storyline', 'music', 'combat', 'series', 'exploration']",below is my original review but since ubi rejects all it 's steam users imo they can go to hell i will never buy any ubi product that is not listed in steam i went into this game expecting a completely different storyline assassin 's creed 3 was suppose to be the end of the desmond story but in a fashion it continues in 4 i was not disappointed the story has been very well written through out the entire series i must also confess that being a rum drinker and already knowing the song drunken sailor i was pretty happy with the music through the game usually i wind up turning it off as a distraction after hours of play but for this i listened and found a few more to like ('worst old ship sometimes mistakenly called waitin for the day now ranks among my favorites the game has plenty to play through on both land and sea i 've had a ball blasting and ramming ships (down to tha drink as well as the usual fights and skulking about there are a few of the annoying scripted fights but only for the story 's sake with hints at more to come i will of course look forward to seeing what may come of the future (or in this case the past
"['graphics', 'storyline', 'movement', 'series']","assassin 's creed 4 black flag is a really great game compared to assassins creed 3 as 4 has more good graphics ,story line ,rpg mechanics etc as for me the parkour of the game was still the same ,awesome and as well as good when l played assassins creed 4 for the first time l was really fascinated by the improvements made by ubisoft on the other side assassins creed 3 had really boring story line whatever the case maybe assassins creed 4 is really good game and l really like it l recommend all assassins creed fans to try all assassins creed 4 as this game is still a masterpiece"
['errors'],my progresses are all gone and now every i go into the game i need to play it from the start i asked or help but no responsemis given the game is cool but uplay is stupid
['no topic'],pure fun
"['assassin theme', 'series']",by far the best experience i have ever had in an assasins creed game and arguably the best assasins creed purchase i have ever made
['pirate theme'],steam baited me by putting black flag on sale now ubisoft is handing out free copies december 14 december 18 fml games great btw
"['no topic', 'exploration']",one of the best games ever really nice ship /fleet system questing and a big open world with so much to do
['no topic'],best assassins creed imo
"['series', 'pirate theme']","greatest ac game to date also greatest pirate simulator /experience/sandbox, call it how you like well until skull bones comes out"
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'movement', 'graphics']",this is a game that has some extremely high points and extremely low points let 's start with the good sailing after the first hour or two of faffing about the game gives you a pirate ship and sets you loose on the seas most of the fun times you 'll have in the game will be sailing around and getting into incredibly dramatic ship battles on the high seas if you 've ever played sid meier 's 'pirates!' then you 'll be pleased to know that sailing in black flag is basically a modernized version of that you have to manuever your ship to bring cannons to bear while staying out of their firing zone by managing your ship 's speed and manuevers in one memorable moment i assaulted a british fortress in the middle of a storm riding waves and dodging artillery as a british man o war and a pair of frigates bore down on me using a wave to barrel out of the way of an artillery barrage before delivering a round of heavy guns onto a man o war 's backside is absolutely thrilling stuff the sailing alone is enough to make me recommend the game it 's incredibly fun and incredibly fresh the story (ignoring the modern day headache that the game insists on vomiting onto you now and again is alright if fairly predicatable one problem i had is telling apart the male pirates it seemed like i killed about 8 pirate guys that betrayed me somehow and i had some sort of beef with but i didn 't really care about the details of the templar /assassin nonsense anyhow so i 'll give the story a pass i liked james kidd quite a bit after all the problems with the game are basically everything else let me discuss the major points first whenever you go back to land to take an assassination mission the first thing you 'll be asked to do is tail and /or eavesdrop on someone this involves jumping on a rooftop as they walk along town (and needless to say every town in the caribbean has a good five or six guards inexplicably guarding rooftops or hiding in a bush as they walk along if you fall behind mission failed start again not fun second the land combat is ridiculously easy i did some early assassination missions made some gold and then bought the wheellock pistols which have massive range but do less damage unfortunately for every spanish soldier in the caribbean pistol damage means shit when a headshot is an instant kill no matter what for when i did do melee i had a pair of swords that i bought in the first hour of the game that let me jump around going for a stabathon on all the bad guys without much trouble but honestly that wasn 't even the problem there are three points in the game where your weapons get arbitrarily taken away in an attempt to get you to use stealth but even with just your wrist knives you can kill infinite guards with parry and break defense sure it 's fun at a visceral level to walk up to a fortress of british soldiers and kill everyone inside but dark souls this ain 't. third the game wastes time with bullshit there 's this entire diving minigame with unique mechanics where you 've got to dive underwater for some treasure while using air bubbles and dodging sharks it 's a terrible minigame that no one in the right mind would want to play and ubisoft seemed to recognize this because you only have to do it once you can explore ship wrecks as an optional thing on your own but it 's such a tedious busywork section that no one in the right mind would want to do it which brings us to the central point which is that ubisoft has no idea how to tell a good idea from a bad one instead of underwater travel or tailing (and i 'm not even going to talk in any detail about the stupid fucking modern day office /hacking crap they could 've given the sailing a bit more depth and made more things to do at sea as it stands the game is great fun up until the point where you 've got your ship upgraded to the point where you can take on two man o wars with ease at that point the game sort of peters out and you 'll fast travel from story mission to mission to wrap the thing up just goes to show that while a team behind a game might have talent you still need a director with a coherent vision to make a game great without that vision you end up with a scatterbrain game like ac black flag still cool that a brother is heading a big video game project keep improving ashraf ismail
"['series', 'gameplay', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'music']",best assasins 's creed game since brotherhood well balanced and vareity gameplay perfect setting and soundtrack .due to the large amount of content the game is delaye for a long time and this is only single -player. 8 .5/10
"['pirate theme', 'exploration', 'optimization', 'frame rate']",i 'm not that into these ac games but black flag was a pleasent surprise treasure hunting diving looting plantation a word to the wise the game has massive system requirements 1080gtx 6core i7 32gb ram maxed out 1080p around 30 -40fps.
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'graphics']",this game is so good it has amazing ship combat treasure pirates beautiful graphics its probably the best pirate game out there theres only one problem though its an assassins creed game this game has so much potential yet its constantly held back by assassins creeds terrible storyline one minute you 'll find yourself looting and plundering doing pirate stuff the next you 'll find yourself thrown into this stupid 'assasins and templars abstergo storyline its horrible not to mention every 2 missions is some sort of 'follow this guy without being detected or 'sneak around these guys without being detected quest its such a huge change of pace going from taking a fort or fighting off enemy ships in a hurricane to sneaking around people slowly or following some guy through the street .slowly. i know i should have expected this considering this is an assassins creed game but it bothers me to see a game this fun wasted on a series im not too fond of they should have just ditched the assassins on this one (and ditch uplay too while they 're at it that being said if you dont mind the occasional stealth missions here and there this is an amazing game that i would highly reccomend despite how much i complain about it it has a huge game world which you can roam around freely great combat both on and off the ship and stunning graphics
"['storyline', 'series', 'character', 'pirate theme']",trailing mission pirate edition is the fourth installment in ubisoft 's critically acclaimed trailing mission game series in this game you play as edward kenway grandpa of connor kenway it 's very clear that theyre related to the auditore /miles bloodline because like his predecessors and successors edward just can 't seem to do anything else but follow people around occasionally he kills people and makes jack sparrow references 9 .7/10 its ok
"['pirate theme', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",assassin 's creed iv black flag focuses on less assassin work and more pirate fun i see this as a positve and the world is fun to explore for completionists however be prepared for a large task ahead of you there are hundreds of random items and chests that do not do much especially the uncharted ones in the open sea other than that black flag is a very enjoyable game and i recommend it to everyone interested
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",assassin boats sea chick thinking she 's a man boats cannons pirates game version of black sails or potc if fan of those you must play
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'graphics', 'stealth', 'movement']","+sea fights +great sandbox gameplay +good story about pirates life +fancy graphics +not annoying economy system .just kill and plunder +pirates songs -boring combat system (since ac1 ).its looking good ,but its too simple -degenerative ai -stupid stealth despite horrible ai and stealth (actually this is weaknesses of whole series this is one of the best ac i ever played"
"['uplay', 'optimization']",this needs to be taken down it doesn 't run and seems to be entirely down to ubisoft 's launcher connect drm strikes again edit after lots of different attempts to get the game or some version of it to run an update to my (amd) drivers solved my problem game now launches fine and everything seems to be as intended definitely recommend now as long as this game is kept compatible over the years it will stay recommended
"['customer support', 'optimization', 'errors']",any game that launches through ubisoft connect / uplay there is always a risk of losing your save file or your game getting stuck and frozen in a certain point of progression (if you can even get this game to launch i 've been in about 6 live chats in the last 2 days with ubisoft support trying to fix multiple bugs i couldnt even launch the game it would ask me for a password and then give me an error code (fixed by uninstalling u connect uplay garbage and reinstalling in admin for some reason the installer needed admin privileges couple sweet hours of gameplay later my game screen freezes still but the minimap and quest markers move freely and audio continues as if nothing is wrong ubisoft support takes my msconfig32 and dxdiag for no reason and tells me to download the newest driver as if they just made some big update for this old ass game thats all they could help with screw it i 'm uninstalling buyer beware amazing game on console

"['storyline', 'exploration']",best game ever love the story line and its very enjoyable recommend not to hurry up with the story line but explore map first
"['storyline', 'assassin theme', 'character', 'series']","a very entertaining game at the start it seemed like it would be a game that i would just roll through but once the story gets going i found that it was a very good one it does a different take on the assassin 's, more focusing on the character than the creed but anyone who has played a previous ac will definitely enjoy it in my opinion"

"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'stealth', 'movement', 'graphics']","i 'll start by saying i 've never played an assassin 's creed game before this one that might have some bearing on my opinions of it maybe not this game is pretty damned good though even without the (what i assume to be over -arching ac story it stands up the modern -day stuff could have in my opinion been taken out entirely and it would have #1 been just fine and #2 made just as much sense story -wise. being a pirate is fucking awesome i haven 't seen a game yet that really captures the feeling of sailing on the high seas as well as this one it 's not exactly like loz wind waker where you have to be mindful of the wind direction and such but it feels really good anyway the naval combat is superb as well and while the boarding actions (and the resulting cinematics afterwards don 't necessarily seem realistic in the midst of a huge battle but it works anyway upgrading the ship feels really good too you can customize your sail color and figurehead with unlockables but there 's really no better than the crimson sails which you get fairly early on and i never changed finding upgrade plans in underwater chests and with treasure maps is always neat as well and really gives you a reason to explore and honestly you 'll be exploring anyway the game mostly open -world, so you can completely disregard the main story -to a degree -and just explore and conquer the seas my advice though would be to at least progress throught he story until you get the diving bell it 's really not all that far in and you need it for certain ship upgrades i made the mistake of conquering about 50 of the map before i did that but it 's not really a huge deal the hand -to-hand combat is a bit trivial you really only need to wait to block then hit kill not a lot of challenge but it 's fun anyway usually all the stealth bits are also there as you would expect from an ac game and those are done well so what 's bad well like i said before i gave 0 fucks about the modern day missions they kinda sucked me out of the game and while they don 't last too long they 're kinda boring and have pointless mini games thrown in one of them is literally just frogger they also pair you up with an it guy with all the social skills of a broom in a dark closet just an annoying character and to top it all off towards the end of the game it gets stupid like really stupid this is one of those moments where maybe it would make more sense if i had played the earlier ac games but they don 't give much explanation for it here and it 's just a big wtf moment like i just want to go around doing awesome pirate shit but they make me walk around (because that 's all you can do in modern -day missions and watch some weird shit they offer no real explanation for there 's hints about the ongoing templar -assassin war happening even today but it still felt really unnecessary that 's honestly my only complaint it 's an aweome game being a pirate is fun as hell they tie in a lot of actual historical figures from the age of piracy the sailing is great harpooning is awesome i just disliked the modern stuff but hey that 's what the series is would definitely recommend even for those who haven 't played assassin 's creed before"
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'assassin theme']","probably the best assassin 's creed game there is just speakin the truth if you love pirates hunting killing attacking boats type sh ^t, this game is to get even if you haven 't played any other assassin 's creed games"
"['graphics', 'storyline', 'series']",this is by far the second best game in the assassin 's creed series specially the graphics by far the best experience ever with no glitches whatsoever (the one thing that took down unity the storyline was good and the environment was something that i have never seen before a must play game for assassin 's creed fan apart from the story itself the side activities are even better next stop rogue xd
"['errors', 'uplay', 'customer support']",the game crashes everytime you open it at the starting screen when it says connecting to uplay server you can 't play this game period edit go to the installation folder delete the 'dlc_10' folder you have it it 's weird but it works my review is unchanged cause i got no support from ubisoft this is a community workaround
['full screen'],no fullscreen bruh
"['optimization', 'frame rate', 'graphics', 'uplay', 'series', 'combat', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'music', 'entertainment value', 'pirate theme', 'movement']",at first this game dissapoints being a poorly optimized port from ps3 (judging by those files steam \steamapps\common\assassin's creed iv black flag \multi\videos\ps3_name.bik) with framedrops in open spaces which are primary part of the game and out of sync engine cutscenes i 'd really prefer them prerendered in this case i wouldn 't mind extra gbs laptop 's hd5400 can 't handle them unfortunately (plus 13 .4+ driver shuts off display 's backlight for reasons unknown but it handles enclosed sequences aveline dlc and multiplayer it just needs better preferences section i can 't turn off bloom multiplayer graphic settings don 't save at all mp and sp .exe are separate but i can 't have fancy french voiceover and english voices for sp punkbuster service may need some kind of repairing but it works i never noticed cheating it feels like in development game was remade so software experience was partially forgot so new problems appear but gameplay is awfully addictive i just got it for multiplayer but was dragged into pirating i still played half of it ('one more location /mission and i 'm done shanties are amazing exploring is interesting even with reused buildings settlements look way to similiar there are activities for any taste and they feel like one whole thing aveline dlc was enjoyable (no learning curve bullcrap there straight to action what 's best for me is multiplayer it just keeps improving with every game now there 's game lab for costumizing game modes assasinate mode which encourages stealthiness and caution even more wolf pack is like a missing piece it 's both practicing ground and co -op variant
"['exploration', 'stealth', 'uplay', 'cloud mechanics']",i love the idea of open world sailing games i liked this game despite not really liking the console -style climbing /fighting/stealth genre of games i liked it right up until ubisoft deleted 150 hours of game progress from their cloud service since then i hate this game
"['storyline', 'combat', 'graphics', 'cloud mechanics', 'uplay']",10 /10 playing since release bought again on steam because why not best story of all assasins most charismatic characters adicting naval combat beautifull environments no cloud saves uplay saves are not compatible with steam version
"['storyline', 'pirate theme']",very good game this is how a realy open world should be this ac game is totaly different than the others but still you feel like you are playing a ac game on the good way you can customize you ship totaly to your style and terrorise the sea very nice system with building and upgrading your ship the main story is fun but nothing realy special 8 .5/10
['no topic'],best game ever
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'combat', 'stealth', 'series', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",featuring an array of leisure really titanica assassin 's creed iv black flag has characteristics which should always be at the heart of every game at free exploration which is a cohesive and credible and many secondary activities to justify the roam around the map if to this we add a compelling plot well placed in the historical context of reference and fun to follow the result is a chapter of the saga able finally to stand up to the second episode for innovations the centrality of sea life and content density sorry didn 't see the same courage in facing some of the ancestral deficiencies such as the combat system weapon anchored again always limits but the renewed emphasis placed on stealth reminds us that the soul of the assassin 's creed race much more again on a concealed blade compared to a sabre in combat just twelve months away from the third chapter the qualitative leap also brings a pleasant surprise with ubisoft who unexpectedly one of the best signature entertainment products that the saga of the killers has ever offered to fans

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'optimization', 'series', 'graphics', 'movement', 'stealth', 'entertainment value']",hands down the best pirate simulation game on the market this is the game that disney wishes they could make with the 'pirates of the caribbean license as it accurately models all of the appropriate kinds of things that one could ever wish for from a game about pirates sailing the seven seas looking for treasure check intense naval battles and skirmishes that you just manage to survive by the skin of your teeth check carousing and brawling in taverns and dives throughout the west indies check check and check as a pirate game black flag is just about perfect as an assassin 's creed game well let 's just say that ubisoft could have completely left that whole assasins versus templars subplot out of the game and none of us would have missed it in all honesty the ac franchise has floundered somewhat in recent chapters of the series so if the pirating part of black flag weren 't so strong to make up for the lackluster plot contrivances of the greater mythology i would have come away disappointed but as it stands i 've got alomst 100 hours in on this game and reached 90 completion buti could easily see myself adding to that total just trying to track down all the hidden treasures upgrading the jackdaw running resources all over the world with my fleet and plundering anything and everything that sails the open ocean this game is amazingly beautiful as well not everything about it works as well as it could the same control issues that have plagued the series from the beginning remain edward too often springs off in the wrong direction or grabs a ledge when you want him to air -assassinate someone and don 't even get me started on the cluster -frak that is deck -fighting. and although there was some effort put towards improving stealth play it 's still falling well behind games where that is the main mechanic i still found myself much too often just saying 'forget it and wading in with dual swords drawn at the very least the number of 'remain undetected missions is kept to an absolute bare minimum allowing me to enjoy the campaign without screaming obscenities at the screen (so far the only real obsceneites have been directed towards the optional legendary ships who cheat like the floating cheaters that they are i certainly recommend this game for fans of the series but also for those who were never a fan of the series unlike previous entries edward kenway is not an assassin nor does he really work for them he 's out for himself and his friends and it just so happens that their interests align at times because of this you don 't need to know the backstory to understand edward 's motivations or what he 's doing from moment to moment if you 're a fan of pirates at all it 's well worth the price to pick up this robust game
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'graphics', 'storyline']",finally a good pirate game  graphics are amazing naval combat is insanely fantastic and original the gameplay has be refined the map is huge the story seems interesting so far
['pirate theme'],the best pirate game
"['storyline', 'errors']",loved the story and most of the gameplay definitely one of my favorite ac games there are some bugs though that are very annoying especially during challenging parts and tailing missions here are done poorly other than that though i loved the game overall
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'series', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",tl ;dr a super fun game with a somewhat slow start and a shift in the classic ac style   pros  stealth via bushes naval combat lots to explore still looks pretty good  cons  tailing /trailing missions (typical ac repetitive gameplay outside of the animus price assassin 's creed iv black flag is definitely in my top 3 of all the ac games i discovered the series pretty late into their run playing the first entry just before this one came out around 2012 i really enjoyed and hated them at the same time for many reasons that most people who are familiar with the series can guess black flag is interesting as it is definitely an ac game with familiar assassination style missions similar tailing missions and continued lore however you aren 't really a member of the order and the narrative isn 't extremely related to the other games in the series when i first played this game nearly 10 years ago i remember being really disappointed by the seeming non -assassin's creed aspects to it but returning to it now i find it refreshing and very fun ac has been very justifiably clowned on in recent years and i must admit i think the newer entries (and some of the older ones for that matter frankly suck this one is not one of them the naval combat is extremely satisfying and really fun while it isn 't very in depth i still found myself devoting several hours to just 'scourging the seas for the hell of it imho just shutting your brain off and having fun is a major plus in a game not every game needs to reinvent the wheel or be extremely philosophical sometimes it 's nice to just have fun the tailing missions in this game are pretty minimal (though the beginning may make it seem more prevalent and much easier to cope with than in the previous titles given the addition of bushes for stealth my primary two gripes with this one are the non -discounted price and the gameplay when you are not in the animus $39.99 for a game that is nearly 10 years old is ridiculous whether it 's a nintendo title call of duty or ac it 's just plain insane on sale though at around $10 this game is an absolute gem extremely fun and still looks good definitely recommend on sale happy gaming
"['series', 'combat', 'character', 'storyline', 'optimization', 'difficulty', 'graphics']",assassin's creed black flag is one of the best game from ac series . i finished the game three times completely this time with all achievements and challenges despite a few bugs especially in character movements the carribbeans are wonderful a great open world map many islands and mysterious places to explore naval combat is awesome and improve his ship take a long time good thing with that by the way an other ac game without difficulty levels so it 's too much easy and it seems more like a pirates game than an assassins game that 's not a bad thing but the mood of ac (creed and all missed in black flag edward kenway is a pirate before an assassin lovely character with a good story to follow now let 's go sailing edward 'blackbeard' thatch 'we fly no colours out here but praise the lack of 'em. so let the black flag signal nothing but your allegiance to man 's natural freedoms
['series'],the last good assassin 's creed if you ask me a definite recommendation to every gamer out there
['pirate theme'],should 've called it pirate 's creed
['no topic'],just remaster it already
"['pirate theme', 'music']",what will we do with a drunken sailor
['series'],this game fixes everything wrong with ac3 and then some i recommend it not just to fans of the series but newcomers as well
"['errors', 'uplay']",ubisoft connect single player game that demands an online connection there is an offline option but most of the time it refuses to launch the game by crashing it while loading paying customers are forced to jump through hoops to make the game work offline then it can randomly crash after hours of play and suddenly demand you go online again before allowing the game to relaunch without crashing rather ironic that a game about piracy can only be played without grief by clueless pawns and actual pirates i paid for a game not persistent spyware
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'music']",assassin 's creed black flag is a game that brings you the awesome pirate life the main charater 's name is edward kenway father of haytham kenway which you met in assassin 's creed 3 he leaves home for a pirate life hoping for great fortune and riches but it turns out to be a more bumpy ride than he first had thought after some missions you will get your own ship which you can upgrade by increasing the number of cannons the armor of your ship mortar cannons a battering ram so you can crash into enemy ships and so on the game encourages you to sail around and fight other ships board them and steal their cargo in order to upgrade your ship with metal wood cloth and money rum and suger can be sold to get even more money when you destroy enough ships you will get more wanted stars the more stars you get the stronger pirate hunters will be spawned and they will hunt you until you manage to remove the stars the seas are vast and there is loads of stuff to do be it gathering mayan secrets for something to be revealed or following treasure maps and finding your treasure and don 't worry after completing the main story you can still sail around and do these things and if you are done with the main story or everything what i love to do is to put on some epic pirates of the carribean music while sailing however this is still an assassin 's creed game so you will still be doing missions quite similar to the previous games like 'tail the target 'eavesdrop the conversation 'kill target 'escape area and become anonymous and so forth but there are also missions where you sail with your ship to destroy another enemy ship the main story is worth completing because it is really entertaining and you will meet many interesting and cool characters the ending was to me quite touching in different ways if you (like me doesn 't like the 'new futuristic world where you sit in a machine then there is both a positive and negative side the negative side is that you are in a kind of machine the positive side is that they have removed many of the animations inside the world where it continously remind you that you are not in the world in the previous games you would see things manifest around you like you were in a machine you don 't see it as much in this game and you are only drawn out of the world about 5 times so because of this i feel that this is an improvement i recommend this game to anyone that is interested in the pirate life sailing around in your own ship fighting the royal navy or pirate hunters this is without a doubt my favorite assassin 's creed game so far
"['no topic', 'full screen', 'optimization', 'uplay']",this is one of ubisoft 's best games 'why the thumbs down you ask as of their last update the full screen option is not full screen it is so small that it is unplayable it is fixable using a mod on nexus it is inexcusable that they chose to break the game for everyone who paid for it and the modding community had to fix it get your sh together ubisoft
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'storyline', 'optimization']","good game about pirates a bit strange game about assassins some chapters are awesome some are just good but there are no bad or boring chapters edward is a very charismatic interesting character which has its own position in life gameplay is quite diverse from classic assassins creed missions to hunting sharks ,whales and orca the only thing that disappointed me is the poor optimization for pc and the lack of diving places if you haven 't played the previous games ,it does not matter you can still play assassin 's creed 4 there are not so much related with other parts things 9 /10"
"['uplay', 'customer support']",we're unable to register this game to your ubisoft account right now as the ubisoft server is unaviable please try agen later for more than 48 hours on ubisoft connect do yourself a favor and don 't buy anything from ubisoft
['series'],best game in the franchise imo
['combat'],the unique ship combat made this game what it is a
['no topic'],too much water 7 .8/10
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'frame rate']",assassin 's creed iv is definitely one of my  goty 's for this 2013 mind you i haven 't played any ac games before so i was a bit skeptical of spending a full $60 on it however one hour into the game was all it took for me to realize i was wrong i love the caribbean setting and everything the developers added to immerse the player the characters were also very lovable and they made the storyline amazing all the sidequests and missions were incredibly fun but some became a little tedious if i 'm on the topic of complaining i might as well include that this was a very poor console port being locked at 30 fps don 't get me wrong -the graphics are incredible and the attention to details such as foliage blew me away however i was dissapointed when i discovered that even my beastly rig couldn 't run it at a higher framerate than a console overall i recommend this to anybody as long as you don 't mind the performance issue
"['graphics', 'audio', 'audience', 'pc requirements', 'difficulty', 'story', 'game time', 'price', 'bugs']",graphics  you forget what reality is  beautiful  good  decent  bad  don ‘t look too long at it  ms -dos gameplay  very good  good  it 's just gameplay  mehh  watch paint dry instead  just don 't audio  eargasm  very good  good  not too bad  bad  i 'm now deaf audience  kids  teens  adults  grandma pc requirements  check if you can run paint  potato  decent  fast  rich boi  ask nasa if they have a spare computer difficulty  just press 'w'  easy  easy to learn / hard to master  significant brain usage  difficult  dark souls grind  nothing to grind  only if u care about leaderboards /ranks  isn 't necessary to progress  average grind level  too much grind  you 'll need a second live for grinding story  no story  some lore  average  good  lovely  it 'll replace your life game time  long enough for a cup of coffee  short  average  long  to infinity and beyond price  it 's free  worth the price  if it 's on sale  if u have some spare money left  not recommended  you could also just burn your money bugs  never heard of  minor bugs  can get annoying  ark survival evolved  the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs / 10  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
['pirate theme'],this game inspired me to be a real life pirate by downloading this game so i never have to deal with ubisoft 's pathetic always drm bullshit
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'series']",assassin 's creed iv black flag is a mix of assassin 's creed ii and iii on steroids i have played assassin 's creed ii and the story was amazing and so was the combat but here its amazingly expanded upon adding your own crew and ship to sail is what makes aassassin 's creed iv huge the sandbox style to this is something special as a ac fan i think it brings a new taste and adventure to the table edward has many new tricks up his sleeve you are taken on an amazing quest of adventure in the caribbean the year is 1715 you will encounter many spanish and english along the way as you explore the caribbean secrets and ruins of the mayans the combat is fluid and a real enjoy to watch as you take part in it this game is a must own if you are new then it does not hurt to try or if you are a veteran then you will look forward to this
"['storyline', 'stealth', 'pirate theme', 'exploration']",arguably the best title in the franchise the stealth system is similar to that of far cry 3 which is a welcome addition there 's also sailing whaling pirating freediving and all kinds of distractions
"['uplay', 'customer support']",uplay is required for this game i 've been through this dance before with this kind of garbage drm not being able to log in having my saves wiped logging in every fucking time i want to play the game etc and i 'm done supporting companies that do this i don 't know why ubisoft punishes people who purchase their games but don 't worry ubisoft the lesson has been learned i will never **purchase** another ubisoft game as long as i live not even if they remove drm from every future game and vow to never do it again i 'm done with this company i know that doesn 't mean a damn thing to them or to anyone else but how i spend my money means something to me and they will never see another cent of it
"['exploration', 'combat', 'music']",never played any ac games since ac2 and this one was amazing the exploration in this game is in another level traveling with ship and discovering new things and treasures upgrading your ship and fighting in sea was beyond good the combat on land also was pretty good and soundtrack was great too over all an amazing assassin 's creed game with tons and tons of interesting things to do 9 .5/10
['pirate theme'],can be a pirate who takes over man o wars with his bare fists 10 /10 but in seriousness though the best pirate game out there
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",a horrible assassin 's creed but the best pirate simulator ever 11 /10
"['storyline', 'combat', 'movement', 'graphics', 'series']",finally got around to finishing this game after having my saved game blown away during a format if you need closure from ac 3 like i did this does a nice job of wrapping it up the graphics engine was overhauled and looks really nice the dialogue isn 't too bad and the voice acting is pretty solid as well the bad if you didn 't like ship combat in ac 3 you 'll hate the core mechanic to this game the ship is how you move around the world map how you do a ton of the story missings and overall is about 40 -50% of the actual game edward 's movement goes wonky sometimes and he jumps over targets or goes up the wrong way of a tree and can make for frustrating gameplay the collectibles from the start are insane it looks like the animus bukkaked your screen with them without explaining what some of them even are the good you get closure to desmond 's story and edward 's story isn 't half bad the actual assassin missions play like ac 2 which i enjoyed a lot of stealth required and the bushes make it easy to sneak around to get to your target the gadgets are also well done the dart gun is a lot of fun with berzerk darts the ship combat is fun but towards end game isn 't as useful unless you 're just collecting items overall it 's just another assassin 's creed game if you like the series this is definitely one to get

"['customer support', 'cloud mechanics', 'uplay']",ubisoft has such terrible support for cloud saving researching the forums google search after google search to find help i moved my steam client to another hard drive to have more space for my games and updates what i didn 't know is doing so means you lose all of your work but keep your achivments the achivments now serve only to mock you and what you have losted fc3 maintained it 's saves yet this game doesn 't. why this service is still maintained if it could be called even that is beyond me you litteraly have to go through two stupid launchers before playing your game startup is like this steam >uplay(you have to install this seperatly and create an account )>steam uplay /ubisoft wants to be like steam so badly it is a cheap imitation of it if i ever saw one do not get this game until ubisoft starts supporting assassins creed 4 like they do the s ..h..i..t launcher edit i actually found a solution to the problem here is what happened uplay and steam where located on my c :/ drive in the default settings location my 4tb hardrive e :/ is where i moved steam to after completing steam installation on the e :/ drive i launched ac4 bf however despite the saves remaining in the spot indicated by uplay (c:\program files (x86)\ubisoft\ubisoft game launcher \savegames/...) the game was not picking up the files and was telling me that i would have to start anew as it would turn out i found out that if you install uplay on the same drive as the game e :/) and copy and paste your saves correctly it fixed the problem
"['graphics', 'entertainment value']",awsome game with amazing graphics highly recommended
"['no topic', 'optimization', 'uplay', 'errors', 'graphics']",ah yes update a 10 year old game to change the way you get micro transactions and break features in the process -fullscreen is gone -saves wiped -doesnt say i own dlc when i do -graphical glitches -signing into uplay every time i open the game
"['difficulty', 'graphics', 'music', 'story']",easy normal hard 'dark souls graphics 'ms paint bad meh graphics don 't matter in this game good beautiful masterpiece music bad not special good beautiful story this game has no story god awful it 's there for the people who want it well written epic story price underpriced perfect price could be cheaper overpriced complete waste of money wait for a sale requirements you can run it on a microwave average high end 'nasa' computer length very short (0 3 hours short (3 10 hours average (11 50 hours long (50 90 hours extremely long (90 110 hours no ending fun i 'd rather watch paint dry hard to enjoy repetitive enjoyable ride of your life replayability it 's a one time experience only for achievements if you wait a few months / years definitely infinitely replayable worth buying yes no by far my favourite ac game one that i played once and again then again hence my playlist on spotify of roughly 600 sea shanties pirate songs and irish folk songs and my weird obsession with 16th century pirates so i could be biased when i say it 's the best one especially considering the ones that came after
"['graphics', 'storyline', 'combat']",ac4 :bf is absolutely stunning it runs well is an amazingly unique experience has a great story phenomonal graphics and is very well polished the naval combat is a fresh addition and the ambiance is incredible this game rivals ac2 in terms of enjoyability something i thought the franchise would never be able to accomplish this game is a must -have.
"['series', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'optimization', 'movement', 'graphics']",assassin 's creed is a series that every gamer has heard of and one most have tried but up until now i have somehow avoided it without trying to i opted to start with black flag due to the fact pirates are cool and that 's as good of a reason as any in my book i also read plenty of reviews and most people rate assassin 's creed ii and black flag as the best in the series and i liked the look of black flag more now i have to say i like elements of it but overall it 's not quite as good as i was expecting for a number of reasons first off i had no idea the games were a simulation and you were just some guy logging into the world for research purposes this completely threw me off and was one of the reasons i couldn 't really get into the game for example i was just starting to get into the story (which i enjoyed mostly when suddenly i 'm told to log off of my workstation and walk around the office to access a colleagues computer to hack into their email i shit you not i had to stop being a pirate to go read fucking emails every time i was brought back into the real world it completely killed any story immersion and ruined the overall experience a big selling point of black flag was the naval combat system and honestly i didn 't enjoy it especially in the beginning when your ship is without upgrades and speaking of upgrades as i chose not to do all the side fluff i was extremely low on currency which meant my ship was always under geared for quests and i was often told to upgrade the jackdaw before continuing i also found myself unable to afford new pistols and swords which was a shame in comparison i did enjoy the melee combat system though while it 's simple and does get repetitive after awhile it is satisfying and fun jumping off a building and skewing two guards on your way down never got old throughout my playthrough it would have been nice to gain access to combos and special moves as you progressed later in the game which never happened something which mad max did really well it would have helped with the combat feeling stale after awhile another big part of the game other than hand to hand combat was the parkour you can run across rooftops climb up towers swing from trees and go almost anywhere you want to but at the same time it does feel very scripted in a way for example i wanted to climb up through a window but the game wouldn 't let me until i took one shimmy to my right there was no reason for this edward could have clearly gotten through the window where i asked him to but the game just wasn 't coded to allow it stuff like this happened all the time and it was quite frustrating a huge plus for the game was the voice work especially matt ryan (constantine) as edward but the entire cast was well voiced and it really helped to push the story which sadly felt fragmented due to the way it was told you would often skip ahead in time and find yourself in a new area after jumping on your boat and sailing out to sea i felt this really made the story confusing at times this coupled with the immersion killing real life sequences definitely hurt what could have been a very enjoyable story overall technically the game worked fine for me it 's 2 years old now so you 'd expect it to but even with a gtx 970 i had to turn off physx entirely as well as lowering a few settings to maintain 60fps 99 of the time 1080p the in -game vsync did cause issues though the game uses double buffering which meant whenever i dropped even a couple of frames the fps would drop to a locked 30fps to fix this i had to disable vsync in -game and force it along with triple using d3doverider overall the game looked and ran nicely with a little tweaking so i can 't complain too much on this front overall the game was ok it didn 't blow me away but it did do enough to keep me interested in the series and i will be moving onto syndicate next which apparently fixes some of the issues i had with black flag especially the real life segments which are now relegated to short cut scenes instead of lengthy playable sections hopefully ubisoft will scrap the whole simulation angle in the next game and just stick to being period themed throughout
['no topic'],very good game
['no topic'],game was good sad to see ubisoft left steam for epic games i have started avoiding buying any games from this company now
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",buy this game for the assassins stay for the shanties
"['assassin theme', 'series']",just one more awesome assassin 's creed chapter
['no topic'],i bet i can describe this game in three words best game everrrrrrrrrr
['no topic'],bought the game saw it had an update and then i can 't fullscreen and the preforms terribly a decade old game that did not need an update and ubisoft breaks it to sell a remaster this is bull shit that aside this game is fantastic can 't recommend with it in this sorry state though
"['character', 'storyline', 'assassin theme', 'combat', 'music', 'series', 'exploration', 'graphics']",probably my favourite game in the ac series what stands to me out is our character edward kennway unlike most ac games where the mc is always somehow connected to the assasin brotherhood be it a parent or family member being part of it or has a connection to the ever going fight between assasins and templar like in ac 3 edward stands out we have not a lot of background information about but is it really necessary what is there to know about a welsh man chasing a dream being ready to go through hell so that his live can be full of adventure while managing to have wealth to spend for the ones he care theres no need if he had a rough childhood is trying to avenge his dead parent /s or trying to protect the love of his life .(btw these welsh are just built different sheesh there is no ulterior motive no 'i do it for the greater good or dead parents like most ac games start he wants to become rich while living the adventures life or die trying in a way its actually a really basic mc motivation kinda like monkey d luffy and while following his own set path it just so happen that he comes across the battle between assassins and templars it is only after coming in contact with them and on the way losing pretty much everyone of his friends where he realise that he can have a much bigger effect on the world i think i never felt so much for a character in an ac game close to it maybe ezio in revelation but i definitely related to edward more gameplaywise theres only one thing i want to say when sea battles where hinted in ac3 i was so hyped to see how theyre gonna develop it due to next game being pirate -themed. and by god i love it so much the excitement that i feel everytime when i managed to defeat a warship i fucking love the music they play when you defeat ships or the forts its so fucking epic and the peak being obviously the legendary ships with each one having a certain gimmick to the fight (btw against the duo ship fight you can techically make infinite money if you defeat one and lose on purpose you still get the 10000r from the first ship after now playing it on pc and remembering all the fun i had when it first came out and i played it on the ps3 i can only recommend ac 4 black flag to everyone who has a love for a good old open world ac game 2 swords / 1

['no topic'],ubisoft just recently set the precedent that they can and will remove your access to their games at their whim even if you buy this game right this instant there is no guarantee you will still have access to it 5 years or even 2 years from now you will buy effectively a digital paper weight i uninstalled all my ubisoft games and will be removing the ubisoft drm program next
"['uplay', 'errors']",cannot activate the cd key through uplay 'we're unable to register this game to your ubisoft account right now as the ubisoft server is unavailable please try again later
['series'],"back in 2012 i said to myself 'me, let 's play through these assassin 's creed games i keep seeing and hearing about in order that was roughly 5 years after the release of the first ac game nearly 10 years later i 'm only 6 games behind this one was good really good my favorite so far see other reviews for details i 'm just here to give a thumb 's up hopefully the good stuff was carried forward into unity"
['no topic'],game of the century
"['errors', 'uplay']",dlc does not work do not buy this game i have both the season pass and gold edition activated on uplay and most of the dlc is missing
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'character']",one of the best assassin 's creed from the series the unbeatable and remarkable pirate feeling is making you feel the most ruthless assassin also the protagonist is very well written and expressed consistent with the story presented in the game thumbs up for developers
['no topic'],ahoy me hearties it 's our time for a reservation that will be remembered through sanctuaries in the history books xd
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'character']",very good pirate game alright assassin 's creed game i liked the characters but didn 't care too much for the story the gameplay was really fun though if you don 't enjoy the boat aspect you probably won 't enjoy this game too much
"['pirate theme', 'storyline']",the best ac made the sea battles are the original it turned a remake into a game that can 't be beat
"['storyline', 'combat', 'series']",nice great game with good story and great gameplay multiplayer is good is recommended for story and gameplay edit well what to say i think this was the best ac game story i had played so far nice game would recommend for sure and only if they would improve the multiplayer it would be so nice
['pirate theme'],to me this is the best pirate game ever in the whole pirate game 10 /10 i download the offline and now i buy it in steam wanted to try multiplayer
"['storyline', 'series']",assassin 's creed the last few years pretty stormy developers as if seized by sea sickness tossed from one side to the other from maneuvers on tower defense to the yankee homeland and the wars of independence it 's worth paying tribute to ubisoft unlike the developers of another annual series the creators of the saga about the assassins are constantly albeit not always successfully yet they tried to find new gameplay moves to open other setting horizons in order to somehow refresh the mechanic who had become full of mischief most of the innovations were not appreciated by the fans and it became clear that it was necessary to decide on serious conceptual changes and finally developers decided on them
"['series', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'combat']",the best assassin 's creed game in the series genuinely i loved this game so much the epicly vast map is unreal and the amount of stuff to do is almost limitless i really love how you can sail around just blowing the crap out of random boats and stealing their cargo 10 /10
['assassin theme'],its assassins creed ...must have
"['assassin theme', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'graphics']",hands down the best assassins creed in the series if you played assassins creed iii and didn 't like it no worries that game was garbage in comparison even ac2 doesn 't have shit on this my only issue with this game is that its not optimized that well for pc even high end computers seem to have significant frame rate drops enjoy the hell of it but don 't expect a smooth 60 fps the entire way through that being said the graphics are incredible if you have the system to display them perfect game for the winter too if you have seasonal depression this game is like a portal to the caribbean overall game 9 .5/10 i 've played and beaten this game three times and i 'm still going to play it again the gameplay is incredible and the graphics are superb if you factor in the poor optimization and performance 9 .0/10. you need a pretty solid rig to run this game on ultra settings ps i never touched the multiplayer so don 't factor that in to this review
['character'],main character is welsh 5 stars
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'movement', 'graphics']",when i finished with the disappointing assassin 's creed iii i vowed that the only thing that could get me to buy the next one is if they made it almost entirely naval battles looks like ubisoft was listening i 'm very happy to say that assassin 's creed iv black flag may be my favorite assassin 's creed game of all time it is certainly the one i have spent the most time playing at almost 60 hours it 's competition is of course assassin 's creed ii which had a great cast of characters and a story that spanned several decades black flag 's story is not as strong but there are plenty of great characters and tons of open -world activities to entertain you in the meantime it also doesn 't hurt that pirates were one of my minor childhood obsessions the key to including side activities in a game is to make them enjoyable black flag succeeds so well in that area that i focused most of my time plundering ships taking over forts and doing assassin contracts rather than advancing the story missions this lead to several amusing moments where i played story missions clearly intended to teach me how to do a side activity (take over a fort for example only i had already done that activity several times on my own some side activities are better than others attacking and boarding ships never really gets old but i only hunted when i absolutely needed a particular pelt to craft a piece of equipment the downside to making an ambitious open -world game like this is that it may have been a little too much for the developers to handle there were numerous times when my movement would be impeded by invisible obstacles and there were occasional objects getting stuck inside walls none of this was a game breaker but it is something you notice my favorite was in a scene where blackbeard was being very menacing very serious and then a bug changed the tone of the whole scene https ://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=omlurqru0pe if you play black flag simply for the story you probably won 't think it is an amazing game it 's biggest problem is that it lacks direction it tried at the end to bring everything together with a fairly emotional scene in which edward reflected on all the people he had lost on the way but it didn 't feel like enough the real magic happens while you are just having fun sailing around fighting royal convoys and pirate hunters getting caught in storms and listening to your crew sing sea shanties speaking of which the soundtrack is once again wonderful and it keeps getting stuck in my head while i am away from the game i have read a lot of people complaining about the modern -day story that the game advances every once in a while i didn 't mind but i think that may have to do with my unique perspective i 'm a computer science student and abstergo entertainment is somewhere i could totally see myself working at in a couple of years i enjoyed just walking around looking at all the nice equipment they have visually black flag is a beauty my biggest complaint about assassin 's creed iii 's graphics was the resolution of their textures and that problem has definitely been fixed i suspect that the new generation of consoles had to do with that assassin 's creed is the only annual franchise that i have been able to get behind and i think the key is variation the unifying element is freerunning but there have been many twists and additions to it that help keep each game feeling fresh couple that with the fact that there are many different settings for them to choose from and i predict that this series will continue on for quite a while $60 is definitely a reasonable price for this game and i also feel comfortable recommending it as a jumping -in point to the series for those of you who have missed out on it until now
"['storyline', 'exploration']",awesome game love the story got so many things players could do love the story
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'combat', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']","a pirates life for me the assassin ’s creed series hasn ’t changed much since it ’s holy -war debut back in 2007 ubisofts signature blend of parkour /stealth gameplay framed by a compelling and often kojima -esque meta -narrative is a formula which has never needed much improvement but each addition to the series has built on its predecessor adding interesting new mechanics and hooks (i’m looking at you revelations to help keep things fresh black flag places you in the recently liberated boots of captain edward kenway a rough round the edges loveable rogue with a quick wit and one thing on his mind treasure and whist templar conspiracies and secret wars with assassins are rife in the vast caribbean ocean kenway ’s only interested in such affairs for as long as they 're profitable to that end black flag positively encourages exploration and adventure to the point where the main story quickly becomes a secondary concern which isn ’t to say it ’s not worth playing through in fact black flag ’s main narrative is arguably one of the strongest in the franchise the overall tone is light and humorous (certainly in comparison to the sombre quest -for-revenge that was aciii and there ’s not a single character amongst the myriad cast of famous -named swashbucklers that doesn ’t feel fleshed -out and well characterised the game also offers an overwhelming number of side activities to indulge in and keep you occupied many we ’ve already seen in previous ‘creeds’, but some welcome themed additions to the roster include whaling diving hunting for mayan treasure and battling with the caribbean ’s 4 ‘legendary’ enemy ships but trust me when i say leave fighting them until your endgame the huge world map is revealed incrementally as you travel from island to island and large sections are filled in with the successful takeovers of heavily guarded forts these effectively act as synchronisation points for the overworld map highlighting nearby towns islands and explorable shipwrecks as well as a plethora of other pirate collectables and it ’s well worth taking to time to collect them building materials and plans are needed to upgrade and customise the jackdaw and you ’ll need plenty of reyals to kit kenway out with new gear if you want to stand a chance late in the game you ’ll soon find however that some of black flags most enjoyable moments come from travelling between the caribbean ’s various points of interest naval combat has been refined and perfected from its role as a side -quest in aciii and now features the ability to board and takeover enemy ships the feeling of broadsiding a british man -o-war in the middle of a typhoon before swinging onto the deck and wreaking havoc with a bandolier full of flintlocks is one that ’s seriously hard to beat throw in a heroic hollywood -esque score (composed by iron man 3s brian tyler and you ’ve got an experience as close to being in a pirates of the caribbean film as you could ever hope for even out of combat the sounds of the ocean distant cannon -fire and sea -shanties chorused by the jackdaw ’s crew make for a scenic and atmospheric ride although your ships ability to magically vacuum up any floating loot and sailors that drift by does little for the immersion of course the games various glitches and bugs don ’t help much either all too often your high -profile free -run controls will send you jumping sideways onto a path you didn ’t necessarily want to go down and a .i musketeers have an unerring ability to hit you even when you ’re behind cover but these are minor issues in an engine that ’s otherwise seriously impressive in short assassin ’s creed black flag is a tremendous technical achievement and arguably the best in the series to date stunning visuals impressive sound design and fast -paced, free -flow combat make for an engaging and immersive experience upgrading the jackdaw and kenway adds a satisfying rpg element and there ’s some excellent scope for customisation the story is well paced and quick to get going although certain mission types soon start to feel repetitive but if and when you get bored there ’s always something else to do whether that ’s hunting elusive white whales to craft kenways next costume or trying to unearth buried treasure with only a hand -scrawled map for direction the important thing is that you have the freedom to choose and surely that ’s what being pirates all about well that and treasure yo ho"
"['graphics', 'character', 'storyline']",pros beautiful vast open world edward kenway is an excellent rogue top -notch side -missions cons main missions suffer from repetition assassin 's creed lore has devolved to nonsense very few actual assassinations my score 9 .7.
['series'],best ac gameplay game
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'storyline']",awesome game i love the mix of pirate battles and assassins it 's always fun to boarding enemy ships the story of edward kenway is emotional and full of action a must have for assassin 's creed fans
"['storyline', 'character', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",assassin 's creed iv black flag is a successful action packed adventure game that pays great attention to free roam while offering a interesting and heartfelt story that is set in some of the most beautiful places in the world the story is great interesting and there is never a dull moment the characters are individually personalized and make great companions the protagonist edward kenway is a daring powerful and fearless protagonist and is fun to play as the controls for the game are solid and easy to use at all times the game -play is engaging fun and wild lots to do places to visit challenges to complete and with the jackdaw edward 's ship you can go out to sea and take part in some detailed and well structured naval battles the game -play is refined and open to all possibilities making free roaming fun and a joy the game is designed well cities like havana and principe look superb and well constructed from every angle and aspect which is another great thing about this game enemies are smart in some way and vary in combat style and looks assassin 's creed iv black flag is a truly elevating and incredible experience and is one of the best action adventure games out there still to this very day
"['errors', 'uplay']",for at least a year there 's been a persistent issue where the steam key doesn 't work with loading the game ubisoft is no help do not buy from steam you 'd be better off buying it for an xbox or ps console instead i 've played through it in the past and it 's a great game but i 'm disappointed and frankly extremely irate that steam is keeping it up despite it being unplayable
['errors'],game won't even start anymore as most of the legacy titles are completely broken while ubisoft focuses on mirage and can't fix their games
"['entertainment value', 'storyline']",amazing game the sailing is awesome and there is soo much to do the story feels a little bit cut short but even then i already got 70 hours of gameplay out of it
['full screen'],the game starts in windowed mode it is impossible to switch to full screen mode
"['frame rate', 'uplay', 'optimization', 'errors']",i 'm truly gutted that this game will not work i played up to havana with the frame rate stuttering everywhere on a 2080ti and 6700k with 32gb ram so i exited the game to look into the framerate and surprise surprise the internet was full of advice on how to remedy this upon loading the game for a second game i 'm now plagued with the exe failed to respond error i spent an afternoon trying all the various fixes from the internet and four reinstalls later i give up everyone tells me this is the best one but i can 't even load it i 've honestly never had a issue like this in twenty five years of pc gaming i 've always been able to remedy a issue but this time i 'm beat stay away is my advice update i tried everything and the game would no longer load seems to be something to do with steam linking to uplay with regards to the failing exe error i got a refund downloaded a repack version and the game game runs fine at 4k 60 fps everything maxed and physix on low and the stutter is gone just completed it and what a game my god it 's easily my favourite just a damn shame i had to resort to a repack seems to be a 50 /50 chance whether this game will work which is a crying shame i can 't recommend this game as it is through steam
['no topic'],*do not buy ubisoft updated game to kill it before remaster release
"['storyline', 'character', 'combat']",i really enjoyed black flag the story characters and world were all great the ship combat is probably the games best feature and could be a game in itself
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'graphics', 'movement', 'combat', 'entertainment value']","i highly recommend this game to any fan /non fan of the series i have yet to finish the story and i won 't include any spoilers all in all this is a well rounded game with excellent game play and stunning visuals i 'd like to shout out to anyone who may have dreamt of being a pirate surfing the high seas in search of loot and plunder is an experience in this game that is brought to life i have spent so many hours just causing mayhem over the deep drink of the ocean and taking 200 screenshots of the beauty that just follows aside from all the praise just as any open world plat -former/parkour type of game it has its downs in mobility where running and climbing can be a challenge in direction and controls and the combat sometimes can be a bit to 'i-win' in the bushes type of game past all this the game is just beautiful and the story very much captivating i give this game a 9 /10, 10 for graphics /scenery/sound, 9 for mobility /combat/play-ability, 10 for hours spent out at sea the beauty of it all http ://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/901013884159611908/03c52e524de4aad6ffc5c3d1e227f6f069a95fd8/ an evening sail http ://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/902140326679863017/5f7ae187531d08ea4c63fb2140939c63ff5a5996/ avast ye me hearties http ://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/902140326712736215/ef48d1d1e275f11b3bc358eb5e2af6c8afca693b/"
"['series', 'combat']",one of my favorite assassin creed games and will never be topped the hit reg and blocking and parrying is a little bugged but isn 't that bad
"['assassin theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'music', 'uplay', 'series', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",had an amazing time with this game the best assassin 's creed game after assassin 's creed 2 the story albeit slow is amazing the combat mechanics has improved totaly like the dual cutlass the main focus is on the sea where you travelled between islands with your ship the jackdaw you can upgrade and customize your ship now the secondary objectives only applies to the story mission you can play on the sea all day long pirating attacking ships plundering harpooning diving etc the music is great too especially the jackdaw 's 'radio'. the kenway 's fleet minigame is good for extra income and you can play it with your smart devices by installing their app multiplayer is awesome as always it got game lab mode which allows you to customize a game wolfpack coop mode also got improved the parts that i don 't like is lack of weapons in this game you only have cutlass and hidden blade for combat no small weapons anymore like previous game but you got pistols 4 of them which is good assassination missions are same and boring but the final reward is awesome (pistol sword ftw xd no more silent ranged assassination since no bow or crossbow dunno pirates don 't like bows the main villain didn 't get much spotlight and kinda forgettable collecting uncharted chests and animus fragments is a hassle this game deserve 9 /10. totally worth it
['pirate theme'],great pirate game
"['pirate theme', 'entertainment value']",be wary of a good amount of bugs it being ubisoft and all but it 's still a very fun game i mean who doesn 't like to be a pirate and swashbuckle other ships it still doesn 't have whirlpools though 8 /10
"['assassin theme', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",easily the best assasins creed title yet eveything feels so polished and crisp it really is an experience to play trhrough especially with hud settings turned off
"['graphics', 'full screen']",does it not have a fullscreen setting i hope i 'm just retarded but my 10 -year-old creed game has been updated three times this year and it can 't match the resolution to my ultra -wide monitor to save its life and there 's no full screen setting again please tell me i 'm stupid and show me where to find such settings until then im not playing this game
"['errors', 'uplay']",ubisoft connect sucks won 't play on the steam deck even after trying different workarounds like turning wifi off so the activation code stops nagging you ubisfot connect sssssuuuuuccccckkkkkss !!!!1!1one
['no topic'],so it would seem
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",everybody 's already said it but it bears repeating the boat stuff in ac black flag is immensely fun the series gets a lot of flak for stagnation and yearly installments but you can tell this one was made by people who really wanted to make something new and exciting sailing the seas attacking forts and boarding other ships finding buried treasure and listening to your crew sing various shanties as the rising sun burns fog off the water 's surface is something that 's actually pretty unique in video games any complaints i could have about black flag are mostly related to some legacy ac stuff there 's about two dozen too many tailing or eavesdropping missions and the controls are slightly improved but still randomly has a bit of that trademark series stiffness thankfully everything involving being a salty sea dog out for the next big score looks plays and controls wonderfully strongly recommended go plunder some booty (and then play this game
"['series', 'storyline', 'optimization', 'graphics']",one of the best assassin 's creed series because it is different than the other games story is great edward is great and ship battles are amazing graphic is good but this game is badly optimized like other assassin 's creed games from series but it 's worth
"['errors', 'storyline']",i might recommend it if it worked the game just doesn 't play in the state it 's in if you can even make it past ubisofts broken launcher and the first cutscene without the game crashing and freezing your entire pc then you have to contend with broken subsequent launching

"['series', 'uplay', 'storyline']","pre-review note  i didn 't have issues with the game that other reviews especially recent ones have been pointing out and in all reality uplay isn 't as terrible as people say it is you just have to download it make an account and if all goes well you 'll never have to worry about it again just don 't forget to put your game keys for additional content in the uplay menu took me a good long while to figure that one out  tl ;dr  hated the game the first time played it a second time years later loved it  actual review (gold edition  when i got this game for console when it first came out i despised it but i kept playing it hoping it would get better after a while eventually i beat the game and walked away dissapointed enjoying only the naval side of the game these feelings towards the game actually turned me off from the series as i had already felt the series was losing its touch since the release of assassin 's creed iii (yes, i was an ezio fanboy and hated to see him go fast forward several years it goes on sale on steam and i decide to go ahead and pick it up to give the game another shot needless to say i fell in love with it the second time the story was much better than i remembered the characters weren 't as dull as i originally thought they were and i was unable to tear myself from the game this time whereas i was forcing myself to finish it the first time at the end of my second playthrough with 100 completion and 55 hours logged i found myself much more satisfied than i originally was the game was well worth the second purchase so if you were like me and hated the game the first time give it a second shot if you are thinking about it you will more than likely find yourself satisfied with another playthrough"
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'combat', 'exploration', 'difficulty', 'stealth', 'series']","not only the best assassin 's creed entry since brotherhood but an excellent pirate game in its own right the story and characters are far and away the most well -done out of any of the previous acs and the open world aspects are substantial and engaging while pirating itself is done well fleet commanding leaves a lot to be desired and the present -day sections (in true ac fashion can feel like a distraction from the main game though there is not a huge incentive to explore many of the smaller islands outside of 100 completition other side quests and city exploration make up for it my biggest critique is that apart from optional objectives and quests where detection results in failure stealth is rarely the best option the combat --while fluid and enjoyable --is easy enough that edward will have pretty much no problem with any group size as long as you are attentive that said the combat is very visceral and well -animated, and enjoyable despite it 's lack of challenge overall an excellent title and easily one of the best assassin 's creed games to date the non -desmond based story makes it ideal for new players entering the series as well"

['no topic'],awesome game
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'frame rate', 'graphics', 'series']",one of the best ac games of all times especially if you loved the naval missions at ac -3. if you are a fan of 'sea legends (1996) then you might like the naval part too the storyline is very smooth and involves quite a few plot twists for the first time you are not a nobel or a rebel just a greedy pirate who seeks personal gain in every task perhaps one of the most impressive facts about this game is the map size as in addition to the 3 large cities you also have access to few dozen small towns /islands and entire sea map that you can travel to conquest ships of unlucky brits or spaniards though it is a pity that there are no portugese dutch or french ships trespassing the caribbean sea on cons you no longer have your recruits to fight for you but there is a solid reaon for it major downside is the frame rate even on a powerful laptop i have experienced occassional minor frame rate issues so i would advise to purchase this game for a video console instead in order to max out the graphics on a pc i have set the 'environmental settings down to medium and left the rest at high / very high even though there were no visual bugs i could not enjoy the small environmental details that would make this game absolutelly superb overall the game is great and definatelly worth playing however brotherhood remains my favourite game of the series

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'music']",when i played assassin 's creed 3 i said to myself 'i hope they make a whole game centered around this amazing naval combat when black flag was announced my excitement and anticipation was highly optimistic after playing black flag i can honestly say it 's by far my favorite assassin 's creed title and quite possibly the best game of the entire series ubisoft has hit every nail squarely with their design decisions for ac4 starting with a new badass main character that rivals the charm toughness and intriguing story of the ezio era the connor character from ac3 was likable in few ways compared to kenway the naval system and combat was improved and given a much larger focus in ac4 as to be expected in a game about pirates the vast scale of the map will blow you away the first time you zoom out to find your location and realize how large this open world is once i took to the seas i immediately found myself unable to stop playing the atmosphere is amazing storm clouds rolling whales jumping ships sailing and battling each other all while your crew sings the most catchy shanties that will have you singing along i seriously loved just casually sailing looking for collectables while listening to my crew sing speaking of collectables they introduced a perfect pirates tie in for collection quests in the form of actual treasure maps the maps would give you a general coordinate to search but to find the treasure you 'll have to study the map and your surroundings looking for landmarks to find the x that marks the spot other collectables included animus fragments sea shanties lyrics messages in bottles and money chests these aren 't hidden collectables but they are scattered all over the open world and add more story for those completion fans now it wouldn 't be an ac game without assassination missions while the games best moments occur on the seas it 's by no means saying the assassin parts are bad they are quite excellent granted the games combat mechanics have not changed or evolved much since it 's inception but that 's not a bad thing entirely they simply want to stick with what works and are not trying to reinvent the wheel of the ac franchise the assassin segments do a great job of adding variety to the environments spanning huge caribbean cities jungle villages island fishing towns and underwater caves the one definitive thing about black flag is you 'll never be without something cool to see or do i didn 't even mention multiplayer yet which is still the same solid game it 's been since revelations my only complaint about black flag was they couldn 't give a us pirate ship multiplayer battle mode all i can say is 'i hope they make a whole multiplayer game centered around this amazing naval combat

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'series', 'character', 'uplay']",first to black flag itself its a nice game if you like the pirate setting the story itself is ok kenway has its good and bad sides but at all the story is way to short and you need to grind alot i liked it but normaly i dislike grinding stuff and want just a great story the story start good becomes better and then ...its going down for the most to the end all the feel you had from start is gone and then its over ....without grinding you could end the game withing 6 -12 hours but you cant you need better ship gear so you can battle the other ships in the story mission would i recomend it yeah its technicly ac1 +2+3+ships. now to aveline whats wrong with you ubisoft guys wasting this girl on another nonsense part of the game 40 minutes of non saying story ...yeah the ps vita port was ok and you wasted her there alot but here tell her story in a full game she is such a nice character i would love to play the full game with her then a warning freedom cry dosnt work well as season pass extra buy the standalone or you will miss video and sound files like fighting sounds ....and some videos so remember buy the standalone if you want to play freedom cry
"['storyline', 'errors', 'frame rate', 'series']",this is one of the best if not the best ac game out there even with its old age it is truly with great sadness that i type this review but the game is at its current state completely unplayable on pc the kenway fleet missions have become unavailable and the game suffers from a frame drop issue that genuinely makes the experience unbearable unfortunately there seems to be no hope of any fixes since the team has basically abandoned one of their greatest creations this game is amazing but i would recommend getting it on a console instead if possible but getting on pc should not be an option all there is now is to hope for a remaster of the game one day
['entertainment value'],love it
['uplay'],the game cannot be redeemed on ubisoft connect due to a activation issue that has existed for almost a year now ('unable to register game because ubisoft server is unavailable as a result the game (including bonus dlc content cannot be activated and played from steam accounts this is a great game (played it through twice previously but unfortunately it seems you 'll have to buy it on ubisoft connect to play
['pirate theme'],aarrrrrrrrrrr i am a pirate now
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'character', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'entertainment value', 'stealth']",october 29 2013 that is the day ubisoft has released the best assassin 's creed game of all time when i saw the trailer for the first time i knew it is a game i could not miss you play as edward kenway a daring and fearless pirate who will not back down the story is truly amazing and there is never a boring moment each character in the game has a unique appearance controls are easy to use the gameplay is engaging fun and wild players can visit stunning places edwards ship named the jackdaw is a unique ship the ship battles in the game are truly spectacular you feel like you are an actual pirate that is instructing your crew to do what ever its takes to win the battle overall the game is designed and well -constructed from every angle which is another great point about the game finally assassin 's creed iv black flag is an astonishing experience and it will be one of the best stealth -adventure games out there
"['series', 'uplay', 'errors']",ac 4 black flag is one of my favorite games unfortunately it was published by ubisoft recently it appears that they have released an update that has broken it for everybody me included (i've tested it they should be punished for that some of them should go to jail for this i will never buy another ubisoft game and neither should you let them know you are not just stupid consumers but that you are people and what they have done is not bad publicity is criminal
['no topic'],
['uplay'],we're unable to register this game to your ubisoft account right now as the ubisoft server is unavailable please try again later solved without any efforts from my side just ubisoft servers decided to accept my cd -key today looking for the controls template for this game for the deck now

"['storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",best ac ever
"['combat', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'character', 'graphics', 'optimization', 'errors', 'series', 'entertainment value']","+standard ac combat system with parries and different weapons but proven sufficient and fluid +whole open sea pirating idea is done perfectly in the atmosphere +charismatic, relatable and interesting main protagonist with hunting dilemmas everlasting greed lust for power and moral difficulties +best feeling in the whole series ive played was cruising on jackdaw aimlessly +there are many leisures to spend money and resources on (weapons, armor ship mansion etc +lots different type of enemies (spanish, english soldiers ships naval forts etc +quite long main game even without extras +lots of extras (treasure maps contracts mayan puzzles armors side quests etc -some glitches here and there that really not a big deal but still existing -main protagonist still cant see the logic to use ladder instead of a unclimblable wall even though i spesifically drive him to it -swords are mostly useless after getting a good one (which i bought in the first 1 hour and never changed it -not rpg game but they tried to add some little rpg elements here and there but unsuccessful -fleet 'mini game really feels like farmville and lacks the depth -npcs are not that rememberable and influencial in gamers mind (blackbears should be more on the front imo all in all i think ac4 is the best game in complete series (march 2017 9 /10"
"['storyline', 'combat', 'series', 'character', 'entertainment value']",the senario isn 't that good compared to ezio trilogy but i wasn 't expecting it to be that good neither those three games were fantastic however the gameplay is seriously good and being the captain of a ship makes you play only this game also multiplayer is really good especially compared to old ones you can customize your character a lot more in the multiplayer of this
['pirate theme'],['you really feel like you are a pirate so careless and free to do what ever you want the best pirate game ever']
"['series', 'optimization', 'bugs', 'movement']",best ac title now we can say ac 4 is a real 'sand-box' game all kinds of contents has improved a lot but still ubi need to focus to catch their bugs also some parts of main playing system like free -running and battle action are tied -up.
"['storyline', 'uplay', 'graphics', 'customer support']",in a world without gold we might 've been heroes main game 8 /10 shanties 10 /10 tavern music 10 /10 really really great game not recommend because ubisoft is selling gold edition but has shut down the server so you can not verify your ownership of any dlcs plus ubisoft sell freedom cry as a standalone game which is already included in black flag gold edition beware black flag gold edition and freedom cry are both in the assassin 's creed bundle ubisoft is charging you extra money one more reason not to purchase assassin 's creed bundle (just to clarify according to ubisoft 's announcement this game wasn 't on the list of 'shut down old games servers yet i still couldn 't verify any of my black flag dlcs from october to november
['no topic'],its great :smile: now
"['optimization', 'frame rate']",it 's a good game the main problem are the missleading suystem reccomended specifications here on steam following rant what are the reccomended specifications for running this at 720p 30fps i have a gtx 570 i7 2600k and 8gbs of ram and just get it to run on medium details 1080p 30fps with v -sync on and around 40s with it off if you want 1080p medium -high details at a solid 60fps a gtx 680 or r9 280x is a minimum
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'uplay', 'graphics', 'customer support', 'entertainment value']",i might be a bit late to the party but i recently picked this up on sale i have not been this immersed in a single player video game for a while assassin 's creed black flag is tons of fun whether it 's the excellent story or wonderful side activities if i was not bombing the heck out of british war ships i 'd be on my row boat spearing killer whales or salvaging treasure from under -water shipwrecks 30 hours of game play in 5 days and it was all worth it i did not have any issues with the steam u -play link like other users everything worked flawlessly i have 0 complaints about this game i highly recommend you give black flag a shot
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'uplay', 'series', 'exploration', 'character', 'combat', 'movement']","i had many issues getting this game to work inculding 1 with uplay seems lots of other people had issues like this too but the game itself is amazing i was never a fan of the series but the pirate theme got my attention the story is quite lengthy which is rare to find in games these days and the huge open world is full of life many naval battles going on out at sea assassins still fighting templars hunting crafting exploring finding tresure maps side missions /stories ect also its based in the tropics so very colorful world also plenty of customization and upgrading for your character and ship its still very assassins creed game and combat system is the same but if the rest sounds intersting to you maybe pick in up when on sale sometimes movement ,jumping and climbing over objects and terrain is a little buggy which sucks when your tryna escape or go stealth thats my only complaint besides having trouble getting it to launch"
"['series', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'animals', 'entertainment value']",i 've played all the assassin 's creed installments previous to this one and i have enjoyed this one the most (ezio is second best i loved the size of the world and the large number of quests and missions i was afraid the boat fighting would be clunky like in assassin 's creed 3 but it was actually very fun it was satisfying taking down larger ships with speed and better tech i also really enjoyed the setting in the caribbean with great artistry on the landscapes and on the water even the animals were fun to kill or just watch i highly recommend this game
"['storyline', 'uplay']",assassin 's creed was an amazing game until they removed access to your dlc that you paid for on 1 september 2022 this is fraud and we should be suing ubisoft for this blatantly illegal act
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",great pirate game still an assassins creed game but has so much more to offer greatly enjoying it
"['series', 'storyline']",my favorite assassins creed game tbh well i didnt play the odissey one (not sure if i spelled it right lol anyways since this is a message from the past (depending on when you are reading it this game is the best for me untill thet make an assassins creed in feudal japan i shall wait and will edit this review once it comes out you 'll know why sooooon hopefully sooner than u think update played the odyssey one it 's pretty cool i enjoyed it greek mythology sure is awesome but hey i want the feudal japan one i still think it will come out xd soon enough next update on this review tba
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics']",lets keep this one simple its assassins creed you guys know it im sure everyone has tried one of the games in the series at some point the story for this one is very interesting ubisoft seems to have changed gameplay up and made the game far more open world so you have the normal assassins creed parkour mixed with hack and slash fighting mechanics with a good and interesting storyline of the battle through the ages of the templars vs the assassins the story is solid making reference to historical characters and events you even meet the real life characters that made piracy so compelling as a storyline throughout the ages after playing through this i feel that it was a much stronger game than every other assassins creed game i played and i own the entire series what did i like about it the storyline while starting off dragging its heels a little was very interesting it almost felt like a movie to me characters were fantastic i loved them all the voice actors did a fine job the actual fighting on land was typical of any assassins creed game here nothing new i found this average at best ship to ship combat and travel was immense this was the most interesting part for me at least braving a tropical storm at sea while in a battle firing cannons at an enemy ship was breathtaking i enjoyed the fact you could attack any ship you wanted i felt this made the game more open and enjoyable ship upgrades were a much needed addon and ubisoft delivered on this no more running from a battle with a larger more powerful ship later on in the game once you have the upgrades needed to take down such ships the deck battles after weakening a ship i found better than the land battles as it just felt right for the the time and location and scenario of the game the side missions as usuall were and interesting touch and i found myself constantly starying from the main story to chase these and complete them while not ruining my enjoyment of the game at all the graphics and sound effects were excellent but you can expect the same movements and similar textures to previous titles but dont be put off ubisoft once again have done a great job makign everything and everyone look good what i didnt like average land combat although the flint lock pistols added some fun it can get repetetive quite fast and i found myself itching to get back on the water to take down a man o war spanish warship everytime the story seemed somewhat short this is usually a case with most assassins creed games they seem to end the story rather short all in all i enjoyed this game it was a very different approach to what im used to with the assassins creed series and what i would say if you are considering this game its a no brainer really to just buy it and play through it at least once that rounds up my review i 'll give this one 8 out of 10
['pirate theme'],best part about the game was the sailing i highly recommend
['uplay'],bought a game through steam so much to my surprise the clowns at ubisoft make you find the cd key and input into their crap system too since we all know ubisoft is prob the worst programmer don 't expect them to intergrate with steam also love having to sign into ubisoft every time i want to play since those morons don 't have a remember me or keep me signed in feature
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'storyline']",a game about the life of a pirate during the golden age of piracy with a neat little assassins versus templars sub -plot. game changes to modern day sections every now and then for no reason detracts from the experience slightly but otherwise is good
"['gameplay', 'storyline', 'series']",i spent about 40 hours playing this game gameplay wise it 's great the gameplay is the same engine as ac3 edward kenway controls the same as haytham connor kenway the ship traveling is the same mechanic but improved greatly sailing island to island ship combat boarding an enemy ship plundering all their loot is a lot of fun something i did probably over 50 times the gameplay is perfect no complaints here i wouldn 't spend 40 hours if the gameplay was flawed the big part of every ac game is the story and i have kind of mixed feelings about the story here on one hand it 's a great story with great characters that takes place in the assassin 's creed universe but the whole assassins vs templars thing isn 't necessarily the main plot going on all of the supporting characters are interesting but i have these complaints with it 1 the main villain of the story is barely seen only a few times through out the entire game we really don 't get to know much about him which is a major contrast to how well we got to know previous ac villains especially the villains in ac3 which we knew quite well only revelations had a villain we knew less about 2 for that matter pretty much all of the antagonists don 't really get much screen time while some characters become good guys others become bad guys very little time is devoted to developing any of the other characters that aren 't one of the main 5 or so characters 3 the motive is kind of hard to understand it starts out simple 'i want booty gotta get rich or die trying and it progresses into something more complicated but it skips a lot of steps that explain why edward has a change of heart and develops into a more mature character at one point in the end of the game one of the villains makes a comment that he 's lost everyone in his life thanks to him the other villains but that 's not true he was already divorced /separated from his wife before the game started a few of his friends died or betrayed him but it wasn 't necessarily due to anything the villains or edward did it was the villain taking credit for what wasn 't his to take credit for at some points edward shows that he cares about people in his life and at other points acts like nobody matters to him but himself and i 'm trying to not spoil anything but come on ac games always have plot twists and characters dying having gotten these flaws out of the way it 's still a very fun game i 'm actually curious where they 're going with the modern day 2013 storyline again where as the 2012 storyline in ac3 was pretty boring ubisoft has said they 've thought of an ending that will be final ultimate but i have a feeling they 're going to keep milking out yearly ac titles until the cash cow runs dry ala call of duty at any rate ac unity looks pretty damn good i 'll be getting it probably around christmas final verdict 8 .4/10 better than ac1 ac3 but the ezio trilogy still reigns supreme
"['errors', 'uplay']",whatever you do do not buy this game it is a trap uplay has cancered this game and pretty much ruined it for many players i have tried a plethora of 'solutions' given by so many sources and i can 't even launch the game before it crashes the game forces you to have uplay on and running while you play the game is there no such thing as gamer trust anymore this game is great but uplay has ruined it (i had this game on xbox for awhile but then i had to sell it
"['errors', 'uplay']",would have been a great game if i could have played it ubisoft has some server issue where it won 't even allow you to activate the key it kept saying server unavailable lots of complaints in the discussions about it all steps were taken and it still wouldn 't work had to refund this game which sucks i really wanted to try this out this was about two days ago and has been happening since early june from what i could see
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'combat', 'uplay', 'graphics', 'customer support']","pros: fantastic pirate story naval exploration combat man o war legendary ship battles present day story additonal lore beautiful visuals and environment really cool soundtrack sea shanties great ui wolfpack multiplayer mode cons: uplay confusing editions and dlc management couple of ship /npc spawn glitches many unskippable cutscenes computer hacking mini -games board games all other multiplayer modes special review section for ubisoft games : should you play ? definitely should you buy ??? yes but on a sale comment: far less of an assassin game more of a pirate game stealth is needed much much less here except for some mission contraints that is good for people who wanted more of an action game inspiration comes from the naval missions in ac3 and this is basically the core gameplay element for ac4 however unlike ac3 this game is a sunny with a vast world to explore you have a hideout too but i barely ever went there your ship is your real home right from the start you can pickup collectibles loot chests and do side missions each of these tasks is neatly accounted for in the stats and visible for each area this makes picking up all the stuff really seemless and that is a big plus checklists are still present but under a really neat ui they are also varied enough to not feel repetitive that is except for boarding ships due to the unskippable cutscenes you can fast travel in both the world map and the town /island map (viewpoints are used here however ship travel is just so much fun i rarely ever used the world map to fast travel this time around you are not a good guy not really you are an opportunistic pirate that murders all the time and it works there is no need to save lives and edward kenway is still likeable in his own way the story is great and i got plunged into the world easily and for a long time it is a shame that a lot of the 'current world story is hidden behind bad hacking mini -games. they are not hard just annoying and they waste time these could easily just have been skipped and the lore given to the player right away and not only that after finishing the game i was left with a 32 /33 counter (got all the files though turns out it can bug out if you do these during the sequences so just do them all after you finish the campaign for multiplayer i can say it stays the same as in ac3 it 's mostly not good wolfpack is somewhat fun and they also added infection and chest defense into it but while the former is okay the latter is terrible general multiplayer is just waiting in queues and overall not much fun anyway ubisoft was dishing out various editions and dlc ever since they made uplay but this time around you need a chart to know what you have and want you see some nitpicking but that is because the game is fantastic so it is easier to find the little things that could be better so don 't get discouraged by the flaws they are minor and i really had a blast playing this game while time just flew by the epic feeling of hard naval battles is something i have not experienced in any other game yet definitely recommended p.s.: to activate the deluxe edition and season pass content take each of the cd -keys steam shows you go to uplay and then to activate a key restart the game and you should see dlc info pop up deluxe edition dlcs : aveline (new character missions illustrious pirates pack (missions items season pass dlcs : kraken ship pack (ship items freedom cry (new campaign illustrious pirates pack (missions items crusader florentine pack (weapons items death vessel pack (ship items guild of rogues (multiplayer characters if you are in the us there is a gold edition that has both deluxe and season pass dlcs . uplay unlockable dlcs : edward the legend outfit (skin), the blades of toledo pack (weapons), the vengeful daughter pack (multiplayer outfit ship items not obtainable community challenge items : explorer outfit captain 's wheellock pistols persian scimitars black and red sails el impoluto 's figurehead el impoluto 's wheel not purchasable : edward kenway the assassin pirate figurine (haytham kenway 's overcoat edward kenway 's unique swords aquila sails blackbeard the legendary pirate figurine (royal fortune sails queen anne sails the benjamin sails for the complete list of content for this game go here *note: if you buy the season pass the dlcs that you can install but the store page will not show as owned are freedom cry illustrious pirates pack and guild of rogues if you liked this review you can find more on the curator page  or in my review corner ."
['uplay'],ubisoft connect suspended my ubisoft acccount for no reason after purchasing this game
"['uplay', 'no topic']",its overall an ok game but i had a lot of trouble with uplay if they would fix the system they have i wouldnt be trying to make the game work for fucking 30 minutes or maybe they could just remove uplay because its supposed to be something optional im not happy about this and i wouldnt do it again
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'series', 'graphics', 'uplay']",a maserpiece one of the best pirate games out there with stunning graphics an interesting story some memorable characters and especially the naval combat system is awesome edward kenway 's badassness has led me to fall in love with this game and made me play other ac series as well personally i don 't like collectibles put in -game just to extend the playtime but i 've put my best effort to collect every single thing in this game i 've spent hours and hours completing achievements and accomplished a 100 synchronization which i normally don 't do if only this was not developed by ubisoft fuck you ubisoft give me back my 100 sync save file
"['optimization', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'entertainment value']",(8/10) far less buggy than the games before or after it and with a ton of content that includes multiple sea shanties there 's a lot to like with this one
['no topic'],do not buy currently ubisoft servers are not accessible which leaves the main story unplayable at 15 aprox as you have to access the servers to view your fleet it wont work and you cannot progress do not buy you cant play this game currently 15 of a game is not worth buying it
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",this is one of the greatest game i have ever played i have never spent over 10 hours straight on any game before until playing this this is unlike any other assassins creed game made before it the naval and sea battles are a massive part of this game and i love it the effects and gameplay cut scenes and story graphics and detail just about everything you look for in a good game is here and ten times over it is vast and endless and will end up racking up some serious hours on this game the things you can do on this game are unreal even if you didn 't like other assassins creed games or have never even played one you must get this hours upon hours of fun
"['combat', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'music', 'series', 'difficulty', 'entertainment value']",great gameplay epic naval combat that is too hard to get bored of it the carrabiean environment is just awesome 10 /10 on the sounds the soundtrack and the shanties as well super boring sometimes during missions where you 've to tail enemies boats /soldiers for the story edward 's timeline is pretty good the last 3 sequences are very nice specifically the ending is pretty nice and emotional the futuristic timeline is not good at all imo the game lost it after ac iii anyways lol overall it 's a great expericne and should be played even if you have never played assassin 's creed before
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'exploration']",i think its fair to say i recommend this game as not only has it entered my top 5 games ever it has a good claim on being the best game i 've ever played it ’s a phenomenally rich and detailed pirate sandbox which takes the typical assassin 's creed formula (of which i am a fan but adds a twist edward is a different kind of protagonist for this series he 's instantly likable as a rogue looking to further his own ends but there is depth to the man he has a conscience and watching him grow as a character makes for a compelling story technically i ’m amazed by what the developers have managed to do the seamless transition between captaining a ship to the traditional assassin 's creed free -running is incredible the simulation of the sea is a marvel as the rolling waves the wind and storms look and feel amazing make no mistake if you have the rig to run it this game looks absolutely beautiful there is so much to see and do in this game its almost impossible to get bored there is such a vast area to explore as of right now i think i 've clocked 30 hours and i ’m just under a third the way through the game
"['series', 'exploration', 'storyline', 'entertainment value']",assassin 's creed iv is one of the best games of the series a combination of adventure and exploration tied in with the story gives this game versatility over the others overall i highly recommend
"['graphics', 'combat', 'assassin theme']","wonderful graphically amazing and the gameplay is on point i do wish the world had a slight more open feel as opposed to mission -based, and the ability to save whenever you please and go back but those are unfair expectations of an assassins creed game"
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'combat', 'character', 'series']",i feel like this game is a love it or hate it kind of game i always see such high praise about it but i myself feel no love for 95 of the game i 'll explain why with some minor spoilers ahead so i 've played all the past ac games and enjoy the gameplay the first time i can remember experiencing something in an ac game i didn 't particularly enjoy was the ship tutorial in ac3 i hated that segment and was very glad it was optional to use the ship throughout the game unfortunately i went into ac4 thinking that the ship would be optional it most definitely wasn 't. i knew the game dealt with piracy but for some reason didn 't look up just how much of the gameplay was based on the ship but because it 's such a big part of the game it made me dislike the game if i 'm on land for a huge portion of time then yay fun times when i have to board the jackdaw and i don 't have fast travel unlocked for wherever i have to go groooooooan so needless to say i did as little ship play as possible and avoided upgrading it as much as possible also your crew sings sea shanties not necessarily a bad thing until you 've a heard that one particular song too many times or b been stuck on this one part for too long and that one jerk starting up a shanty nearly every time you return to checkpoint is pushing you over the edge luckily you can tell them to shut up which i didn 't realize until late in my playthrough i dislike the main mechanic but aside from that i wasn 't too fond of the story you play as edward kenway who is a pirate who wants to be rich he 's obsessed with scoring a big stash of gold to support his girl back home who didn 't want him to leave in the first place that 's really all there is to this character to me he wasn 't likeable and the story all revolved around him needing money so much even the more interesting characters in the game are sidelined while he goes hunting some big score for a series that delves into history so much and introduces you to so many intersting characters i feel they fell kind of short here but that (much like my strong hatred of the ship battles is obviously just my opinion otherwise the game is what you 'd expect from ac there 's hunting back again from ac3 combat is similar to previous games weapons from previous games etc if you 've played ac you know what you 're getting into and there 's nothing really stand out here so if you 're looking for a pirate game where you can sail around and have giant ship battles and plundering booty this is a good game for you if you want to play ac but also want to be a pirate you 're in luck if you 're like me and you hated the ship gameplay in three i 'd avoid this one (and ac rogue
"['uplay', 'pirate theme', 'character', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'combat', 'music']","okay just to start off this game requires uplay i know thats an issue for some people so take that as you will anyway more imprtantly to the game itself and i was quite happy to find there 's been an improvement over the last couple of ac games particularly the awful ac3 in this game you play edward kenway who 's a pirate in the carribbean and it makes for a great setting and experience edward is the best lead character since ezio and is a likeable guy with plenty of personality the games setting is fantastic as well with loads of beautiful tropical environments with the oppurunity to sail around the carribbean and explore you 've got havana ,nassau and kingston as your 3 main cities though these are a bit dissappointing particularly nassau and kingston as they are pretty unimpressive compared to some of the great cities of the older games as for the gameplay it 's also improved all the pirate stuff you can do like attack and board ships and sail around looking for treasure is a lot of fun the assassin stuff almost feels boring in comparision there is also a lot of 'follow' missions in this game as i 've always hated these missions the most in ac games and this one is littered with them that said there still is a lot to do and explore and you will get your moneys worth from this game surprisingly the music in this game is probably one of the best parts of this game as you sail your crew will sing sea shanties which is brilliant and really gives it that pirate atmosphere i 've found myself humming the tunes after playing you can also collect more shanties which will be unlocked for your crew to sing the good great interesting protaganist in edward kenway and a few more interesting characters as well all the pirate activities are a lot of fun the carribbean looks great in this game and you 've a big area to travel and explore in -the music in this game is brilliant the bad -the story isn 't particularly interesting and a bit hard to follow at times the assassin stuff is pretty boring and there 's way too many 'follow' missions -controls still feel awkward and fiddly at times -game can be fairly buggy at times overall this is a step in the right direction again for the ac series and probably my favourite since ac2 it gets an 8 /10 from me"
['no topic'],this is a brilliant game that ubisoft is now attempting to quietly end server support for the game refuses to connect to a server probably because the server no longer exists here 's the headline the game requires server support to literally progress the singleplayer campaign ubisoft are closing threads in their support forums that highlight this issue and pushing them into a megathread where they continually say 'we're investigating but its probably on your end since august do not buy repeat do not buy until the reviews say the issue is fixed
['series'],best ac after the 2nd so far

"['series', 'graphics', 'combat', 'storyline']","after a short wait with ubisoft increasing the assassin 's creed model to one game every holiday season assassin 's creed iv black flag comes out the gates as one of the strongest ac games released since the original dropped back in 2006 i 'll keep my review short as i don 't believe words can replicate or convey my feelings and opinions about this game adequately gameplay without a doubt the strongest and weakest of the franchise thus far the variety in naval land and underwater allows the player to never feel as if they 're repeating the same thing over and over which was a major downfall of assassin 's creed 3 and the weakest entry of the series thus far ubisoft could very well have taken out templars and assassin 's, renamed the game pirates and it would stood on it 's own as a solid ip from ubisoft with that being said having black flag considered an entry in the ac franchise harms a few things swordplay is still pitiful in terms of complexity and effort with the same mindless mashing of x to slaughter endless hordes of templars being intact once again collecting is a tad bit more tedious now but this is something to expect from a game that is next -gen along with being on sea as well as land controls black flag is going to be marked as the buggiest and most frustrating ac game so far ubisoft has yet to figure out how to polish the climbing of this game back to how effective it was in ac2 automating the climbing makes navigating ships more difficult than it was in ac3 (which was already a buggy mess on it 's own and the increased number of actual ledges ropes and trees to climb only amplifies how painful it is to navigate on land and sea effectively but if we turn our eyes towards ship and sea controls this is a gigantic step forward from ac3 the expanded arsenal that edward has available at his disposal along with the seamless selection of weapons makes naval combat a matter of quick thinking and timing rather than jumping through a thousand control hoops i never had to think about which weapon i was using only to gage where my ship was relative to the target and i instantly knew what i had to use and how to use it ubisoft also expanded ship controls beyond combat adding in a travel speed that allows a more relaxing cinematic perspective while sailing the high seas alone on top of this designating one button to dock release and board makes it simple to understand what you want to do at any time story while black flag will never hold a candle to how tighly wound ezio 's initial storyline was in ac2 or the simplicity that we had in ac1 edward 's tale is cleaner more entertaining and enjoyable than any moment conner 's story ever had to offer before you ever take on the robes of the assassin 's, you can feel haytham 's energy pouring out of edward but with more purpose and context playing edward makes it easy to see why we enjoyed haytham so much and why conner was such a disappointment in comparison the continuation of desmond 's story is hard to care about as black flag has a massive disconnect with desmond for much of the story and leaves us wanting more i do hope ubisoft returns to the idea of a modern day ac entry as desmond 's sequences in ac3 felt more difficult and stressful as you are without the animus ui to guide you you like desmond had to adapt to the enviroment and think on your feet instead of being given indicators and waypoints overall if you were worried about black flag after how disasterous ac3 was like myself do not fret black flag is easily the best entry since assassin 's creed 2 and serves to allow ubisoft to go in different directions with a new ip using the naval gameplay of black flag along with pushing us closer to more modern day entries in the franchise edward is what we 've always wanted from an ac protagonist full of character rich with dialogue and meaning and complexity that allows you to believe that what edward is doing is what he wants to do instead of being shoved into his role like conner and ezio gameplay 9 /10 controls 7 /10 story 7 .5/10 overall 8 .25"
['no topic'],only a matter of time until ubisoft deletes this game as well don't buy
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'series']",i really like this game it has a great story and the graphics are well done in my oppinion have played up to 40 hours on playstation 4 i can recommend this game for people who like the series and really enjoy rpg and open world games xd
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'optimization', 'movement']","heyyo wow so much to love and enjoy about this game it 's definitely refreshing how they mixed the ship combat boarding with the solid assassin 's creed foundation it reminds me a bit about the amount of fun i had with sid meier 's pirates back in the day which is definitely a good thing it 's definitely my favorite assassin 's creed game yet side missions / activities are pretty good and varied deep sea diving animal hunting on land and at sea assassin missions trader missions searching for mayan puzzle pieces templar key hunts lots to do one of my favorite little side activities is collecting 'shanties' which is songs the pirates sing and each shanty you collect your crew learns a new song a game where collecting things adds more fun to the game indirectly and in a good way awesome :p on pc it was optimized incredibly well compared to even skyrim even with packing more detail on screen the only poor part is the controls when diving underwater and a current carries you can 't spin the camera and know what edward 's skull is about to bounce off of lol only other control issue parcour the classic controls of right click enables parcour and shift increases the running speed is sorely missed here sometimes it 's hard to tell edward which way you wish for him to move with just wasd that and if you 're trying to make a tight manuver (ie, climbing the masts to cut down a ship 's flag edward will think you meant leaping somewhere else instead of 90 degree turn and climb the mast some more overall even with a few control flaws it 's still my favorite assassin 's creed game to date definitely worth the money especially if it 's on sale"
"['optimization', 'uplay']",hands down the best assassin 's creed game and one of my overall favorite games i dont recommend it because ubisoft fucked up the optimization with uplay and other useless stuff my pc used to run ac4bf with 60 fps on mid settings now i cant even get 20 fps with my native resolution
['series'],my favorite ac game by far well revelations was good but black flag is awesome
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'series', 'entertainment value']","assassin ’s creed iv black flag a wonderful pirate-themed game if you are looking for games in the likeness of сorsairs then you will not find it here because this is an action game with ships here we upgrade a ship a character and rob convoys of ships and сorsairs is a simulator of ships in the first place i really liked the battles with the legendary ships first of all they are very difficult but for loot it is worth defeating them the game is worthwhile and will brighten up your everyday life ...yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum"
"['assassin theme', 'frame rate']",this game is better than every other assassin 's creed game if you wanna play this make sure you get 60fps at least to enjoy this game to the fullest will recommend strongly
['errors'],great game if you can play it too buggy there are several known freezing issues that will never get solved since the game is so old and they are no longer patching it if you can get for under 10 dollars then id say give it a try but if not then might not be worth the risk to sink money into just to find out an hour into the game that you cant get any farther if you do play make sure to turn anti -alising off and fog on
"['errors', 'storyline']",would be a good game if it worked it has repeatedly reset my save games this would be less of a problem in a game that didn 't has mind -numbingly repetitive missions and so many hours of having to do these missions ubisoft is silent on the matter
['pirate theme'],i love this game its wonderful to pirating in huge ocean and board the ships with your own upgraded ship
['uplay'],ubisoft connect makes me angry
"['uplay', 'errors']",ubisoft club is garbo and its messing up the startup for the game
['uplay'],fuck ubisoft connect
"['combat', 'stealth']",stealth isn't really fun and battle system is very basic boat battles felt the same every time got boring fast
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'combat', 'optimization', 'series', 'customer support', 'entertainment value']",do not fight for the pirate king be the pirate king the story begins in the familiar style of the series you thrown straight into the action with just small fragments the circumstances known from the beginning as boatswain from the welsh city of swansea taking 'edward kenway right aboard the many british colonial boats to acquire enough money to make a name in the new world as far the ac games have come so is assassin 's creed iv black flag one of the best ac games i played incredibly huge open world many different places to explore treasures to find many new things new upgrades and many different warships to take down the positives of the game enormous world with tremendous opportunities lots of quests completed and grand pirate adventure the negative of the game some bugs here and there much forward and back and a lot to take into account the fact to begin with so my full scores for this game is 9 out of 10 / fun to be a pirate
"['uplay', 'frame rate']",idiots devs make it where you have to login to ubisoft jsut to play games even though you 're already logged in total fucking failure then they also lock their games at 60 fps come on bro
"['storyline', 'combat', 'stealth', 'series', 'entertainment value']",assassin 's creed has always had a nostalgia effect on me so i had to buy it black flags is a good game i really enjoyed the difficulty on the legendary ships in fact the ship battles are the best part of this game one thing that started to annoy me with this version and others is the assassin missions i remember in brotherhood if you weren 't stealthy the targets would escape on a few missions the devs seem to have abandoned this design and has made these tasks too simple the optional and easy assassin missions felt copied and pasted and there are other areas in the game that lacked in variety i recommend playing this game i would also recommend buying brotherhood and ii before playing this title
['pirate theme'],you are a pirate
"['errors', 'uplay']",i 've played 56 hours according to steam 's clock not that the game would know since it promptly wiped the save on most recent startup given it 's now about 5 months past it 's launch date this is likely the last straw on an unfortunately buggy and obsessively over -restricted pc experience it 's a beautiful game but not worth anyone 's time with such a shitty save system it kind of tells me to stay away from ubisoft products since it appears this is a problem of their uplay system so would potentially catch one by surprise with any of their games sadly the first steam game that has managed to actually have the cloud be a destructive element
['no topic'],i love this game but for some reason i keep losing my progress
"['customer support', 'cloud mechanics', 'series']",sadly i am a fan of assassin 's creed and have enjoyed this game but i can no longer recommend this or any game sold by ubisoft due to major cloud infrastructure issues that are breaking my game saves i have no idea which games will now have this issue on top of the 4 that have it now so i am losing all confidence in ubi not only are cloud saves breaking and causing games to crash (4 ubisoft games so far including watch dogs 3 starlink ac valhalla and odyssey any computer any network but ubisoft has had open tickets from me for over eight months and the experience has been one of the worst customer service experiences ive ever had with a game company the end result of my ticket history is an ubi tech actually retaliating against me (i was frustrated and told them i was going to stop being an ubi customer and putting my support account into 'identity check mode forcing me to verify all my info again even though we were in the middle of a conversation they didnt like my comment about not being their customer and the next thing that happened was my support account is locked as such i am changing my reviews for all ubisoft games still in my accounts all 29 of them that i 've had for over 15 years a company that cannot properly host cloud saves and tries to pass the buck to customers and abuses customer time and patience like this is not a company ill pay another penny to
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",the last few assassin 's creed games hasn 't been so satisfying but this one goes straight to the top on the list of awesome games i really enjoyed this game and find myself still playing after completing the main quest because i want to keep plundering fighting and improve my ship the main story line was extremely good the entire game itself was incredible everything in the game just makes sense and is so well done
"['exploration', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",installed the game and didnt look back for 9 hours what else can i say even with the time spent sofar theres still plenty to learn at first i just explored the area collecting coins and jewels and kicking ass
"['optimization', 'series']",best damn assassins creed game out there right now yes it does have issues with optimization to the pc but other than that its a masterpiece
['no topic'],very nice
['no topic'],dont purchase this game as ubisoft server for this game cd key activation in not responding
"['storyline', 'combat', 'series']",this one was a bit upsetting in that it does everything the previous games do right and has all the same failings the sailing portions are really the best parts but they don 't justify a $60 or $40 price tag in the other areas you 've got the same situation combat is enjoyable and smooth you feel like the grandmaster at work when slaughtering through villages and there is absolutely no challenge if you have a mind to you can massacre everyone in game with hardly a thought and there really isn 't much reason to anyway outside of the structured missions there 's very little to do on the ground and some of those missions can be fairly dull as well such as the ever -present tailing missions an unfortune standby for the series it 's got some good spectacle to it but i 'm not really happy at having such an expensive paperweight just sitting in my library
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'character', 'exploration', 'series', 'entertainment value']",embraced what ac3 did with the ship black flag has good characters (despite a mellow protagonist a fun open -world structure and a side mission progression that feels less like checking things off a shopping list and more like slowly taking over the ocean modern day story line is shoehorned and feels irrelevant but otherwise an extremely awesome experience to get lost in
"['no topic', 'series', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'customer support', 'uplay']",ubisoft makes a game about ships multiplayer has no ships fuck ubisoft honestly it wasn 't a bad game single player was incredible but why even add multiplayer if you 're not going to stick to the premise of the single player gameplay just dont add mp what i will say though is you should buy this game for a single player experience incredible sp just keep in mind that these rich big game developers continue to screw us on multiplayer oh and as for all the complaints like 'it drops to 30 fps well it drops to like 35 on my pc and yes it 's annoying but it 's still very playable my main complaint is just what i stated above oh and as for the ubisoft launcher it 's fucking stupid but ubisoft gets away with it so there 's nothing you can do
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'character', 'storyline', 'entertainment value']",this game is perfect to destress over work /school week sucked take it out on spanish guards the graphics are spot on and edward is one likable assassin to play as need another reason to play this game pirates and you can make them sing for you for hours on end even if you play through the story there is still so much to explore loot and plunder
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'combat', 'exploration', 'music']",pirates assassins naval battles sea shanties sea storms and all open world with the whole sailing ability man this games worth any price or bug :d buy this
"['errors', 'uplay']",i love this game but it has the same error as ac brotherhood (another one of my favs where its the old uplay login and it won 't let u create an account nor sign in to a account i recommend buying ubisoft games from ubisoft directly i don 't recommend getting it from steam because so far i 've only ran into issues
['full screen'],i was unable to get the game to fullscreen i spent hours looking through old forums and reddit threads and couldnt figure it out not sure if im just dumb or if theres a problem with the game /my pc
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'optimization', 'graphics', 'movement', 'difficulty', 'series', 'errors']",i 'll premise my review by stating bf is my first assassin 's creed game as i typically don 't play many (if any rpg games that being said i found bf to be quite good fun i 've always wanted a good pirating game but since i don 't have windows 10 nor an xbox sea of thieves was out of the question the pirating in bf definitely filled that itch even if just in single player since i 've been playing this game i am getting hooked on the whole parry and counter combat so much so i 'm actually looking for games that simply focus on that niche bf is a huge open world game and there is tons to do i am enjoying its crafting upgrading system though i do admit having completed 60 of the game at this point my character already has the best weapons full health etc i 'm at the point now where upgrading my ship is dependent on finding treasure maps to unlock elite upgrades the caribbean landscape is beautiful and reminds me of the first time i played far cry 3 the weather system is done well if you 're not a fan of deep water sailing over huge waves during a storm can feel uneasy missions side missions tend to get repetitive e .g. tail this guy kill that guy and the save points when you fail can get frustrating i found the smaller things in game like pick pocketing random people quite fun you 'll find that after a while the shanties your crew sings will drive you insane to the point that you 're forced to go chase down notes in towns to vary things up though i enjoy the hand to hand combat i felt at times the system was a tad clunky whereas the computer seems to highlight enemies for you if you 're slicing and dicing one foe your character will at times stop to attack a different highlighted enemy before the original enemy is dead frustrating when the aim of a mission or objective is to kill a specific enemy and /or when boarding ships the parkour is new for me and took me probably an hour or so to get used to at one point i almost requested a refund due to frustration but stuck with it and learned the mechanics the game wants you to follow i 'm sure newer games in the ac series have honed this system but it can be frustrating at times when chasing something and your character does something different than what you intended overall the ability to climb walls fences and scale buildings is good fun if you 've never played any of the ac games i feel bf is a good one to start with though many people seem to have their own favorites bf tends to stand out as one of the more popular series in the franchise i encountered glitches /bugs here and there enemies being stuck in rocks not showing up on the mini map until right in front of them from time to time but nothing game breaking i find the random breaks running around animus fodder (a time waster though i believe it falls in line within the picture of reliving past events and is the same in every series of ac for what i paid $6 usd this was money well spent
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'series', 'graphics', 'optimization', 'uplay', 'exploration', 'character', 'difficulty', 'full screen']",forgive me i have a tear in my eye the only thing that keeps this game from consuming my days is my constantly overheating computer it took everything new that worked from assassin 's creed iii and has taken the series in a new direction through a story i 'm eager to uncover i haven 't even encountered the assassins properly yet (i assume they will make an appearance and i 'm having a great time plundering spanish ships and bringing retribution upon those bastard slavers i 've played 13 hours and so far it has blown me away i 've been waiting for a game like this since the original xbox when i played the 'pirates of the caribbean game i 'm actually finding myself wanting to get all the collectibles which is so far rare for a ac game the dual sword combat also mixes it up a little and multiple pistols only furthers the feeling of novelty this game has brought to the table i still see the same kill moves over and over again but it doesn 't bother me enough to stay away from the game more than a day or two i would not recommend this game to anyone without a good cooling system as it 's hard on your computer my mediocre rig can actually handle the game just not for long so be warned she 's a devil in the sack you 'll love it
['storyline'],best assassins creed story ever
"['optimization', 'errors', 'frame rate']",this game is very bad optimized if you don 't have a mid /high-end pc you may have problems like crash to desktop or frame per second not rock solid
"['entertainment value', 'storyline']",i bought it for 7 euros when it was on sales and holy shit it was worth it i havent finished the game yet but dude it 's gonna be a long game i can tell only done 20 of the story so good so much to discover and such good gameplay
"['storyline', 'combat', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'character', 'difficulty']",one of the best assassin 's creed games although it isn 't much of an assassin game pros -the world i could sail around exploring forever beatiful -ship combat is fantastic i didn 't even get the game expecting to like this but i love it -variety of items and weapons -diving missions are fun cons -many abilities /finishers were removed that were in assassin 's creed 3 this game is better so i 'm not sure why it removed portions of combat -the game seems blurry /foggy on all settings hard to describe -you can 't swim underwater outside of diving missions what kind of pirate game is this i love the game but it has some unfortunate limitations still one of the best ac games
['pirate theme'],i wish i was a pirate 10 /10 best pirate game ever
"['storyline', 'errors', 'combat', 'series', 'customer support']",a great game builds off the originals it takes place before ac3 but it 's so much better the few bugs i noticed which mainly just gave me laughs were very few and far between it 'll give you a pretty damn long campaign took me about 10 hours for the main story with tons of extra content after it the dlc freedom cry is ok it 's pretty fun and there are quite a few bugs overall a great game definately worth the buy especially with the season pass
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'graphics']",i only have just under six hours put into the game but i have to say it is everything i have wanted in a pirate game the fact that it is an assassin 's creed game is just an extra it runs beautiful on my gtx 760 and i haven 't had any bugs or problems so far the game is certainly one of the most beautiful games i have played in a long time
"['series', 'character', 'assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",probably the first and last time i 'll ever be able to play a aaa game where the protagonist is from my home town it 's an ok asscreed game it 's an amazing pirate adventure and we don 't get enough of the latter
['series'],best assassin 's creed game
"['exploration', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'combat', 'frame rate', 'pirate theme']",as someone who found running over roofs in previous ac games repetitive and boring i was actually pleasantly suprised with the black flag it 's still the same 'busywork' game we are used to from ubisoft but the range of activities is so wide that you won 't get bored anytime soon i liked change in the enviroment from just plain cities to wilderness and sea (i haven 't played ac3 so i don 't know about that very refreshing there is so much things to do ship battles with eventually managing your own fleet diving to shipwrecks using diving bell hunting using harpoons and i could go on mentioned running across rooftops has been put behind a bit on behalf of these things so there 's just a couple of 'cities' that are nowhere near the size of ac2 cities but i didn 't mind didn 't really missed them graphics is great and runs ok with occasional framerate drops in cities or wilderness (vegetation causes this i presume ubisoft montreal really managed to make a nice tropical world in which you could imagine living which is a sign for me of great work story is a bit weak but you 'll have fun nontheless giving that the pirate theme is not being used much in games this is one of the best pirate games you can get i wouldn 't hesitate to say even the best
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'combat', 'character', 'series', 'optimization', 'frame rate']",***work-in-progress review merely 3 complete and i already know this is going to be the best ac game i 've played to date (not counting rogue unity and syndicate black flag takes everything awesome and fun about ac ii and bring them to the next level pros drop dead gorgeous graphics typical awesome epic pirate tracks fluid and entertaining parkour system satisfying and responsive combat system charismatic protagonist (ac iii sucks finally some female (ac iii sucks assasination missions are back (ac iii sucks courtesans are back (ac iii sucks colletibles hunting no longer feels like a chore (ac iii sucks cons understandbly more demanding on hardware with 3770k 970 16gb i couldn 't run the game at 60 fps with everything maxed out at 2560 x 1440 even at maximum mouse sensitivity camera moves rather slowly forcing me to drag my palm across the mousepad instead of simply moving my wrist golden age of piracy if you are getting one ac game black flag is it

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'series', 'graphics', 'uplay', 'entertainment value', 'stealth', 'movement', 'music']",best friggin pirate game of all time like a full live action version of sid meier 's pirates based on an assassin 's creed engine i honestly didn 't care for the ac series that much but this one is a level of insane awesomeness i can sink my teeth into lots of lush jungle and city environments in the caribbean from desert islands to full cities like havana and nassau fleet management taking ships boarding ships sinking ships sending them on trade convoys and intense nautical combat great gameplay for using chain shots mortars broadsiding with round shot and you could even just leap off the masts and kill the enemy vessel 's crew manually with your assassin skills like any ac game it has the annoying modern sub -plot of the real world where you work in a gaming company with some underhanded crap going on where you walk around the office staring at french lady coworker 's butts in miniskirts but it really doesn 't force you to play that sub plot much i just stay logged into the pirate simulation 24 /7. screw john from it i 'm a pirate the awesome collectable pirate shanties that your crew sings as you sail are stuck in my head now coworkers are confused why i know so many sailing songs literally a full hour of pirate shanties
"['errors', 'series', 'combat']",i liked this game a lot however for some reason it stopped working for me and i can 't seem to fix it i tried a lot of things but it keeps crashing and i was never able to finish it from what i could tell the issue i was having was something that other people were having as well maybe get it somewhere other than steam great game though edit it works fine on my new computer still have no idea what the issue was but definitely one of my favorites from the series now that i 've been able to play all the way through ship combat really is a lot of fun

"['storyline', 'pirate theme']",after 57 h play and get 96 total sync so i can say now this is great game because nice story if you attention to it have good world and map nice sea battles have many tresures and i can give 8 /10 point
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",by far the best single -player pirate game ever and the best assassin 's creed in my opinion if on sale buy it 6 is totally worth for this game hell even 20 is (the full price
"['series', 'character', 'exploration', 'combat', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'customer support', 'storyline']",8 .5/10 finally finished this game after being behind in the series for years and then restarting after getting half way through the game due to needing to factory reset my computer pros great character development huge (at least compared to the other ac games world to explore tons of side quests ship battles are pretty fun (and pretty intense when you get 3 -4 frigates and a couple man o wars on you crafting system was okay and it made you have to go out and hunt to be able to craft hunting was alright harpoon hunting was pretty fun (although the trajectory of the harpoon was a little weird at times cons characters that i really liked died :cries: ship trading route things while good at making money were insanely boring and annoying although i didn 't do every side quest the game seemed a bit shorter than the others every once in a while even though ive done an objective for a main mission it wouldn 't register and i 'd have to reload from my last checkpoint slightly repetitive like all the other ac games (although not quite as repetive as the others to get a full sync on your memories you have to do certain things to my knowledge there 's no way to see what those things are unless you by chance do it without noticing and then see the little progress box come up (about half of my memories are only 80 sync because of this funny bug i found if you jump from the top of a windmill onto one of the rotating fin things while its coming up it shoots you about 100 feet in the air and then kills you when you fall to the ground i 'm almost ashamed to say i did it for a solid 20 minutes because it was funny
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'uplay']",pros my favorite in the series any fan of ac titles or pirate themed games will love this one fast fun action combat stealth tactics with all the parkour trimmings as in any of the ac games prior to black flag battle enemy crews on the high seas through boarding in naval combat while steering clear of violent but awesome storms and rogue waves that will quickly send you into the deep watery abyss if your not careful hunt animals for hides and rescources for crafting your upgraded gear and even dive for sunken treasure or dig it up with aquired maps beautiful graphics fun multi -player action with friends and one helluva story that sets the stage for this grand adventure in the carribean highly recommended cons requires ufail er i mean uplay uplay uplay requires 'high-end' pc to enjoy smooth gameplay without audio issues during cutscenes oh and requires uplay
"['assassin theme', 'series']","this game is great revolutionary for assassin 's creed 4 i loved assassin 's creed 3 even though a lot of people didn 't, but 4 is a major change in the right direction"

"['series', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'exploration']",in my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a steam review for every game in my library (#68 out of 500 it 's time for assassin 's creed iv black flag look for the most part i can 't recommend any assassin 's creed based on the gameplay (it's fine or the story (it's fine or the visuals (its fine none of that is the appeal here no assassin 's creed is all about the settings does exploring a highly fictionalized but superficially accurate rendition of the caribbean sea during the 'golden age of piracy sound like fun to you then assassin 's creed iv black flag is for you it 's not only your best choice but your only choice note also played on sony playstation 4 and nintendo switch

"['full screen', 'uplay']",the game automatically start 's in windowed mode with no way to fullscreen it how does a aaa game studio not put full screen and windowed versions of their game in the options menu absolutely disgraceful but don 't worry the useless ubisoft client will get downloaded on your computer as easy as any malware online when you click the link just don 't expect to play the game after you do without messing with your game config files honestly disappointing enough for me to consider refunding

"['pirate theme', 'exploration']",if you like sea adventure just try this game .8.5/10 must have this game
['uplay'],game now works once the ubisoft overlay is disabled shame on you ubisoft for using it in the first place
"['errors', 'uplay']",absolutely unplayable in 2023 i got the gold edition with tons of dlc and none of it is accessible because ubisoft connect doesn 't work another problem is that in 4 hours of playing the entire game froze and locked up about 15 times i 'm running ryzen 7 3700x rtx 2070s 64gigs ddr3 there should be no issue it also has the same issues on my steam deck it 's not worth it
['no topic'],ubisoft is a terrible company never buying another one of your games again
['no topic'],nice game
"['errors', 'uplay']",i want to play this so fucking badly but the game just closes with historical disclaimer i tried troubleshooting it tried the cracked fix reinstalled it and what not and none of works i previously bought it directly from ubisoft and it didnt work then i bought it on steam doesnt work i feel scammed out if there is any other fix then pls tell me
"['combat', 'storyline', 'series', 'optimization', 'movement', 'graphics']",full price not recommended on sale maybe see below the only reason i got the game was for the naval combat and it 's honestly the only thing about the game i like the bad i witness a 'big' bug almost every time i go do a story mission minor bugs are endless and everywhere combat is awful and occasionally will completely stop working and you 'll just flick your swords until you either die or resort to your pistols shoutout to the genius developer who decided you can only attack when an enemy is highlighted and then making the highlighting mechanic camera reliant btw the camera is absolute shite too and don 't get me started how it locks when you 're being rushed through an underwater current while trying to dodge stone pillars and spikes really nice how you can 't move the camera to see in front of you the free -running is equally as horrifying where you 'll run up a wall next to you while facing the camera away from it forever if you don 't force him to stop and walk away meanwhile running up a fallen tree requires 5 years of training and planning and a runway strip fit for a ww2 bomber and sometimes he still decides to jump off the ledge next to it or just stop at the base completely basically almost every mechanic seems broken or untested when you play enough the story is awful and completely unimpressionable half the time you have only a vague understanding of what 's going on and why you need to be somewhere or doing something now here 's my gripe specifically for newcomers to the assassin 's creed series ubisoft 's decision to make this an ac game was probably the stupidest fuck up in the entire game if you enjoy immersion may want to try somewhere else cause you play as a guy playing the memory of his pirate ancestor if you get this i don 't need to explain any more if you don 't get it no amount of explaining will help moving on the good naval combat it 's satisfying it 's exciting and it drives you to upgrade your ship as much as possible which supplies gameplay only downside is how boarding can result in the bugs you get everywhere else (fucking parkour glitches also the legendary ships are a teensy bit cheap one has undamageable sides so you have to hit it from the front back or from above with mortar another consists of 2 level 75 man o wars that fight you by working together and getting you inbetween them and ripping you apart from both sides (good) but as soon as you kill one the other proceeds to do its best to sit on you with speeds impossible to match so basically you have to kill them at the same time or damn near close to it but anyways on sale for $20 the naval combat is planty to make it worth it had i bought on full price i 'd be taking advantage of steam 's new refund feature the ocd do you hate people who type like this or people who don 't capitalize anything that should be like british or captain blackbeard well whoever wrote up all the text in the game subtitles tips everything was both of these assholes in one box :d
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",best ac game ever
['errors'],this game does require some tinkering to play but it works
['pirate theme'],4 words best pirate game ever
['no topic'],this game is awsome
"['series', 'graphics', 'movement']",to me this is the only assassin 's creed game that i could stomach to play i like pretty much everything about it and the graphics still look good to this day the only thing i dislike is the running and how it automatically jumps onto walls sometimes when you 're running past them which throws off the whole chase if you were doing a chase mission but that 's a crap feature that 's included in all ac games dying light did parkour right not assassin 's creed assassins creed made it too easy still worth buying definitely
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'storyline', 'graphics']",i haven 't played much of the campaign but these are my current impressions pros sailing and sea combat is really fun and addicting ship and weapon upgrades require materials which you get from raiding other ships assassination missions are fun and sometimes challenging collectibles are kinda fun to collect base building is fun and makes useful buildings graphics and water textures are really nice cons a bit laggy if you have a lower end pc or laptop story didn 't catch my interest kenway 's fleet was fun at first but then started to feel like a chore i wasn 't interested in what i saw of the present storyline (but it might get better multiplayer didn 't have anything to do with ships all in all i enjoyed playing this for the time i did i suggest getting this if you think you will like the sea battles *kenway's fleet is a mode where you select your ships and send them on missions and have to wait in real time for them to complete it 's like a freemium app

['storyline'],the best game in the franchise
"['storyline', 'optimization', 'customer support']",it 's a great game >if< you get it running as it should i was sceptical about the whole pirate thing but i really didn 't dislike anything about it there is a fair balance between naval and ground combat edward is an enjoyable character that bears more similarities to the younger ezio than the rather stoic connor did sadly the present -time story isn 't advanced too much you get to know what happened to desmond and you will meet and see characters from the previous games but the present -time story takes baby steps forwards i still believe it holds more potential than what ubisoft is doing with it i understand you can 't advance it too far because this may kill the whole animus thing which is allowing ubisoft to create as many past -time scenarios as they wish but at some point i would want to see solutions to all of it the good things aside there was something dramatically hurting to the game technically -sided: saving didn 't work as it should i lost my progress twice thus far the last time i rushed through the storyline with this in mind and dropped back from 60 progression to 13 or something like that i was in contact with ubisoft support but got no solution to this most of the time i was given copy paste answers one not even adapted to my specific problem but obviously still retaining information related to another ubisoft title 'might magic x legacy on the forums (both steam and ubisoft people seem to speculate a lot about the origin of this issue some people never seem to have it some rather constantly (like me perhaps uplay is timing out or steam or whatever i never had this in the previous ac games and i will be very careful about future titles perhaps i will play them on the consoles again it seems the game simply stops saving at some point on your harddrive but i just don 't know for sure having the uplay cloud synchronisation en -/disabled doesn 't seem to matter since i lost my progress both with and without it i would have to replay the whole storyline again for now i will settle trying to finish ingame whatever i can without that there are some things you can only do once you 've progressed beyond a specific point in the story though like diving for wrecks and i will exit and restart the game and uplay more often now to make sure my connection to it is in proper working order and just to make sure i won 't lose too much of my progress should it happen to me again i had some performance issues too but they feel like a lot less dramatic issue compared to the saving ones there was a lot of stuttering when cinematics were loading or when entering new areas not from the start i think but when being mid -game. some bigger cities like nassau and kingston don 't run with full fps but it 's playable enough and still fairly enjoyable there are no snowy areas not that i would have seen them anyway which were almost unplayable in ac3 performance -wise.
"['storyline', 'movement', 'pirate theme']",picked this up during the sale was not disappointed at all this game is fantastic the story is more captivating for me than previous iterations it has tighter controls and faster freerunning and it features the best pirate ship sim on the market gives me hope back for unity and the future of the franchise after a long period of stagnation check out my full review here in 1080p complete with shanties http ://youtu.be/qh_yffreml0?list=plvv9yy5ptu0vp36rghchiedkziv5l3lil
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'optimization', 'stealth', 'series']",an assassin 's creed game with barely any references to the sempiternal templars vs assassins conflict instead focusing on piracy and exploring the caribbean pros naval battles are quite fun and refreshing ubisoft is slowly learning how to polish the gameplay the theme of the story is surprisingly -strong and focused compared to the other games of the series and that 's not even including the meta commentary on the video game industry cons too much reliance on old assassin 's creed staples like tailing missions and poorly -scripted stealth very unoptimized pc port it 's a bit annoying when you already know from older games how everything will eventually end for poor edward but in the meantime what a cool protagonist to follow
"['uplay', 'customer support']",i really loved the game but i never bought another ac game again because of uplay one day my singleplayer progress was suddendly gone because uplay shut down the servers i still had a local savefile which is encrypted by uplay (ubisoftconnect) and useless without the servers uplay services are unreliable and anticonsumer also i once owned the crew on uplay (ubisoftconnect) but their system had an error and i lost my ownership the support didn 't help me

"['storyline', 'difficulty', 'entertainment value']",finished the game to 100 the game is decent all high level gameplay the whole story isn 't completely understandable at first but otherwise huge a wonderful game
"['series', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",one of my favourite assassins creed games since acii the story could be better but hey anything is better than unity crash team racing has a better storyline and gameplay than ac :unity. once you have finished the game you have hours of collectables forts that we have become used to in other ac titles the controls for this game are great combat is the same old counter -based style which i like the ship combat is easy to get used to for anyone who has not played aciii the free running is solid apart from a few glitches here and there but for me it was a rare occurence in conclusion this game is worth the £20 i payed for it and i would recommend it to anyone who likes to play or have played other ac games 10 /10 would play again
['pirate theme'],pirates !arggghh!
['pirate theme'],best pirates of the caribain sim ever
"['series', 'graphics', 'combat', 'storyline', 'assassin theme', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",as the latest game in the assassin 's creed series the game has lots of improvements in its gameplay including its open world experience great graphics great naval gameplay enough for you to play it for quite sometime however its story was not good and meaningful enough as compared to the previous games this aside this is a great game definitely worth getting if you 're a guy who is interested in history and pirate games definitely recommending this 9 /10
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",15 пиратов из 3 ассасинов не так плохо
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'errors', 'graphics']",a great way to learn the pirate history and have fun at the same time very few errors great graphics
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",black flag is not really an assasin 's creed game it 's basically a pirates game with assasins outfits and hidden blades in which you plunder murder raid spread chaos defy the government and increase the power and resistance of your ship to sink even more efficiently fishing and merchant boats fruits of eden new global order light versus darkness nah gold rum and busty women are the goals of your life in this game also scuba diving shark hunting and panther stabbing games in the always beauty waters and rainforests of the caribbean it 's pretty cool if you like pirate games i enjoyed this one a lot
"['series', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'uplay', 'bugs']",this game is incredible inovative and cre <ative compared to it 's predecessors i played them all and i have to say that black flag is a huge improvement in the ac series it 's awfully addicting and there is so much to explore and collect it 's a very clever mix of creativ breath taking content and solid repeating gameplay like seizing other ships which can be fun for hours the graphics are still amazing now in 2016 too all in all i really have nothing to complain about i had zero problems with u -play and only a few minor bugs (fell threw the floor once and some quest people were missing sometimes but nothing which coudln 't be fixed easily with a reload or a quick travel i totally recomend playing this game
['no topic'],this game is like water slides and i like water slides 10 /10
"['storyline', 'pirate theme']","here 's a tl :dr if you don 't want to read the whole thing the game has a very large amount of stuff to do and if you take your time to enjoy it will keep you occupied for a very long time the pirate story was good but i didn 't like the animus story it got in the way of me being a pirate and i hated that my full review i absolutely loved this game it took me 91 hours to finish over 7 days (yeah, i know that 's a lot of time playing in 1 week of course i wasn 't rushing to finish it so it could easily be done faster however i didn 't just rush through the story i played the game to as close to 100 as i could get this means i completed all the story missions found all animus fragments chests hidden treasures and mayan stones i completed all templar missions and assassin contracts i hunted and harpooned every type of animal i bought all the swords guns and outfits i also crafted all the outfits i could i got every jackdaw upgrade and every upgrade for edward i took out all the legendary ships and filled an entire fleet with level 60 man o war ships there are only a few things i don 't have for edward or the jackdaw but those things are earned from completing community challenges considering that i don 't have friends that 's a bit harder so i get away with that now story wise i found the animus extremely annoying i 've been told that it 's better in this game than previous games it only pulls you out of the animus into the modern day 5 times out of 13 (i think total main missions i know it 's part of the ac series and all but the animus is just annoying to me i 'm perfectly fine with a game having good story but if it interrupts gameplay then it 's just annoying the animus thingy does just that i don 't play a game for story i play it for gameplay if i want story i watch a movie or better yet read a book games are for gameplay as i said a good story is fine that 's why i loved the story within the pirate world because it didn 't interrupt my gameplay i was a pirate i felt awesome while i was a pirate as long as i 'm an awesome pirate i 'd enjoy the story but as soon as it says 'no, you 're just a guy testing a game here be boring i don 't feel awesome and don 't enjoy it enough being annoyed at the animus pirate story i enjoyed it it even stirred up some of those feels closer to the end if they managed to stay completely away from the animus i would have possibly said it 's the best single player game i 've played ...ever....and it 's up against just cause 2 so that would be quite a feat the observatory and it 's weird doohikkyness was a bit silly but i was fine with that because i was still a pirate it 's just the animus literally that 's the one and only thing i can say i did not enjoy about this game i know lots won 't agree with me i don 't care a game is about gameplay the animus got in the way of gameplay it 's a nuisance simple as that"
"['storyline', 'assassin theme', 'optimization', 'series', 'uplay', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",too busy playing this damn game to write a long review so ill make it short and sweet basically takes everything that was wrong with assassins creed iii (hunting weirdness notoriety weridness hiding in tall grass weirdness etc fixes it expands the naval gameplay a fuckton and refines many other aspects of the assassins creed experience most notable refinement is making eagle vision useful outside of searching missions story is good but it doesn 't feel much like a story for an assassins creed game but so far i 'm only on sequence 3 out of i dunno how much either way worth grabbing if you like pirate stuff and enjoyed assassins creed iii but if you 're looking for a more traditional assassins creed game may be best to skip this one and go to unity also sea shanties on uplay it 's annoying but at least they give you free game content for getting achievements with their u points or whatever could be as bad as origin
"['uplay', 'customer support']",thank you ubisoft for ruining my childhood memories with your terrible drm as it stands newly purchased steam copies of this game cannot verify their copy with the mandatory live service 'ubisoft connect making the steam version basically useless this issue has persisted for over 8 months at this point and has no indication that it will be fixed any time soon if you really want play black flag the only way to play it is through the ubisoft store but good luck navigating it wouldn 't it be great if a nearly 10 year old now exclusively single player game didn 't require 3rd party verification to access online features that no longer have support 9 /10 ubisoft ruined my childhood
"['storyline', 'entertainment value']",great story addicting multiplayer 10 flags from 10
"['pirate theme', 'uplay']",this is such a great (pirate not so much ac game that it is a must buy but not on pc as you need the uplay launcher and ubisoft will close your account if you don 't use it in 6 months rendering all your games useless
['no topic'],fun but it gets somewhat boring when you have so much power and money and no use for it the guards are always so dumb it 's ridiculous and the glitches are really annoying
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",great story at least compared to ac3 end rather randomly tho great open world possibility to harpoon dive and stuff it 's fucking awesome i hugely recommend you buy it :p
['series'],best assassins creed game hands down
"['storyline', 'entertainment value']",best assassins creed game i have ever played 5 /5 stars
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'music']","by far one of the best assassin creed 's, probably one of the best games of the last gen fantastic lighthearted but still emotional story great exploration a beautiful art style and a fitting soundtrack i recommend you buy it if you love open world games however if you don 't like the previous ac games there is still a lot of the same ac habits 9 /10."
"['entertainment value', 'assassin theme']",love this game a lot one of the best assassin 's creed game of all time i would recommend this game because it is fun and a lot of hours of gameplay
['no topic'],for the record i had the game installed and was going to play it today 7 /5/23. the game had an update clicked and waited for it to finish now onto the real f **king sh !t! after hitting play and the game opening for only 1 second it just closes before doing this i had to sign up for ubish !t and agree to things just to even get somewhere in to the starting game which i didn 't even get anywhere i uninstalled and installed it already to see if it will fix anything but nothing another thing i did was validate the files and everything seems good but still didn 't work after all that in conclusion i will have to become a pirate myself f **k ubish !t!

"['storyline', 'combat', 'optimization', 'series', 'graphics', 'customer support', 'stealth', 'movement']","it 's mostly a good game the water looks great sailing and naval combat is satisfying i just wish developers would stop taking away control at every second turn and skip (or at the very least give the choice to skip the repetitive and useless animations slow menus repetitive cutscenes automated movements etc it 's the curse of the console i guess or at least all these console ports suffer the worst from it (e.g. tomb raider but it 's just so annoying to have the game constantly leave you sitting there as nothing but a spectator i want to play, not watch the same applies to automated camera movement it 's never helpful always messes up movement has been there since the very first ac title and has always pissed me off what do developers think this adds to their game ironically the parts of the game that resemble the usual assassin 's creed m .o. are the worst and most boring aspects in my opinion the story isn 't very interesting to me (which doesn 't say much as good gameplay is worth a hundred good stories for me personally and my patience for long unskippable cutscenes galore is approaching zero and the parts outside the animus are more of the bad stuff slow tedious boring uninteresting and with that guy in your earpiece trying way too hard to be witty stealthing is so bugged and stealth missions are so randomly infuriating it 's as terrible as ever climbing is hit -or-miss as usual but it feels like it 's gotten worse compared to ac3 (constantly jumping on small crates as if they were a high ledge not going where you want to go small earthen mounds being impossible to climb etc but at least the naval combat is redeeming i wish there were other single player titles focussing on that it 's what sets this game apart and makes it worth replaying multiplayer is terrible and nothing but a tacked -on play of tag if it works at all"

['uplay'],ubisoft launcher asks for a password every single time such a good game wrapped in a turf
"['uplay', 'errors']",buy ubisoft game enters account password to play trys to play the next day password incorrect *resets password doesn 't have authenticator codes from years ago can 't log in to play game amazing
"['optimization', 'series']",i finally got the game to work even though most games on steam usually don 't require this and i feel like a kid again playing one of my favorite pirate games i do hope that this game gets more love an attention from its creators to keep it running one thing needs to be said about the required specs though for i have flying colors is every aspect when looking at the recommended specs with up to date drivers and up to date tech so i have to wonder why i lag while playing a game an xbox360 could run
"['pirate theme', 'entertainment value', 'graphics']",best assassins creed in my personal opinion love the ships love the chanties and most of love being a pirate fun game worth the money plus scenery in this game is absolutely gorgeous
['stealth'],another game where you have to be very stealth i love that i recommend it
"['assassin theme', 'character']",you are bird -son of nobody 's (altair bin -laahad) predecessor it very nice 9 .5/10
['no topic'],i quite like this game but because it 's made by ubisoft the most incompetent corrupt cunts in gaming i cannot in good faith advise you to give them money as this will only further their cuntish ways that is all
"['series', 'combat', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",franchse fatigue is a word that 's often used when speaking about assassin 's creed because ubisoft releases one every year i got hit by it pretty early in the middle of ac2 and never finished another ac past that one i love the gameplay in ac but apart from the main missions most of the things that can be done are repetitive tasks that always end up feeling like a grind (and i 've got a high tolerance for repetitive gaming tasks but they have to be at least a little fun another criticism is that ac never provided any opportunities to create your own fun like you would expect out of an open world so if you don 't like the activities it offers there 's nothing else to do ac4 has all of these issues but for some reason it 's still a pretty good game i did not get hooked right away but once i got far enought to be able to freely roam the open world with the ship it became a pretty amazing experience that no other game has ever done the naval battles are simply amazing it feels more like the ultimate pirate simulator than an ac game it 's something that has to be experienced i finished the main story but i am compelled to continue playing because there is still a crap load of fun to be had with the open world piracy i just wish they had made the naval warfare part of the multiplayer
['no topic'],unless your name is ricky doney and your running a 10 year old computer this is the game for you
"['series', 'combat', 'assassin theme', 'movement', 'stealth', 'difficulty', 'entertainment value']",i consider the black flag as one of my favorite ac episodes the sea battles are exciting though at the beginning i didn 't think it was easy also the game is doing well on its theme assassination there are multiple weapons like handguns various darts and swords by the way it 's also cool to play stealthily to assassinate targets in silence i 'd really recommend this game to my fellow ac fans
['no topic'],great game
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'music']",easily the best game of the assassin 's creed franchise it does away with all the bullshit of the previous game and just focuses on being a bad -ass. a bad -ass pirate that 's pretty much it you 're a bad -ass pirate and it 's awesome also sea shanties
['no topic'],this game is awesome
['no topic'],not until they fix fullscreen ubisoft broke their shit again shocker
['no topic'],awesome when playing multiplayer than solo add me on ubisoft and we can play together (johnfelix616)
"['storyline', 'combat', 'series', 'graphics', 'optimization', 'movement']",black flag was one of those games i skipped because believe it or not i didn 't like the idea of an open world assassin 's creed game and prefer the sandbox assassin 's creed games (my how the tables have turned lol so after purchasing the game on sale i must say whether it be full price or not this game is worth it the story the characters the places and ship to ship battles are all sooo good with that said it 's batshit bonkers that skull bones can 't simply follow this formula instead of following this formula ubisoft in their wisdom decided to do a sea of thieves clone but waayyyy more boring but that 's not what i 'm here to discuss the only two things i can say negatively about the game is the 'modern setting it 's just sooo boring and nothing really exciting happens in addition there is a lot of technical issues at the tail end of the game that i encountered so be aware at all times other than that the gameplay is the same as was seen in the first ac game the ezio trilogy ac iii etc as a reminder this is not the fluid traversing assassin 's creed games we see today it 's all set on where to climb how to kill etc there 's no real freedom in movement or combat so it 's stiff and boy it shows if you play valhalla origins odyssey unity syndicate and then go back and play the older titles the two sets are night and day if you can bare with the older gameplay mechanics the story is worth it and definitely a great ac game in that generation of ac games
"['pirate theme', 'storyline']",i 'm hesitant to give this a grading on one hand i loved the early and mid gameplay there 's something about sailing on the open sea and plundering tons of booty that calls to me and the concept of the open sea and tiny islands made the game feel so much larger than it was however the late gameplay was a complete turn off to me especially the ending fight i won 't spoil anything but i will say that it took many hours and tears before i finally was able to get through the final sequence it left me feelin pretty hollow inside after that i enjoyed my time playing the game but finishing it was such a chore that it took away from the overall experience not only that but the hackin too was pretty awful 3 ways to hack with one of them being a skill showdown whoever thought of that one should go dunk their head in a bowl of water to cool off it was pure evil especially when you needed it to continue the storyline overall i would recommend this game not for the story or anything but purely for the chance to be a swashbuckling pirate /assassin and plunder all the booty get this game on sale or for free or something
['no topic'],that is a game cool
"['pirate theme', 'stealth', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'music']",yar so i heard you would like to become a pirate well look no further because this game is a fantastic pirate game coming from someone that has never played an ac game i thought this game was incredible i however got frustrated at some of the stealth missions during the game however i think that comes down to my lack of knowledge of the game mechanics for the ac stealth so i wouldn 't let that destroy my thoughts on the game the ship fights are fantastic and you could just go on a constant fight cycle for possibly hours on end it never ends so many places to explore so much booty to loot and the missions are fantastic and would highly recommend doing it all if you want to enjoy yourself in this game also the graphics in the game are stunning i can 't get over how good just little things looked like rocks etc to the vast forests and oceans the soundtrack in the game is also fantastic that plus the shanties that you get for your crew to sing is amazing overall this is a brilliantly thought out game and a must have for all players that have either any love for the ac franchise or like me just want a good pirate simulator highly highly recommended
['no topic'],just awesome
"['entertainment value', 'assassin theme']",never been a fan of assasins creed but this one is a blast
"['entertainment value', 'errors']",assassins creed black flag is one of my favorite games the game is extremely fun and enjoyable to play when i was playing i rarely came across bugs or glitches in ac4 there is really never a time you are not doing anything the game is filled with so many things to do so i recommend that you buy this game its well worth it
['no topic'],if ubisoft made a good remaster of this game i would forgive them for everything
"['uplay', 'series']",if the game is on sale right now as of you 're reading this do not buy it you will not be able to complete the main mission when you are on the kenway fleet mission you will need to connect to the ubisoft server and can 't complete the game in offline mode https ://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/100828/ac4-black-flag-the-ubisoft-server-is-not-available-at-this-time-kenways-fleet-and-multiplayer-post-here/492?lang=en-us&page=22 though there was a fix around september but i just tried it and it didn 't work

"['storyline', 'character']",i finished this game after dicking around with it for a long time and all i have to say is ...oh...my...god. this is a perfect recovery after ac3 and is one of best ac games to date the only ac games that kept my interest long enough to actually finish were ac1 ac2 ac brotherhood and this ac the story is amazing and meeting infamous half -drunk pirates like blackbeard horningold kidd rackam and etc never gets old their personalties make the cutscenes worth watching and the dialouge interesting for me the most important aspect of a game is story and characters in ac3 connor was very unlovable and i was always apatheic towards his situation as for edward kenway he is the epitome of a pirate character he is charming charismatic and extremely lovable even when he 's a bastard you relate to him feel sorry for him and desperately want him to outlive all his fast -going pirate comrades the end of this game is also heartwarming and is extremely satisfying leaving the player wanting more kenway in a world run by anarchy debauchery and betrayal assassin 's creed iv black flag is the epitome of a pirate experience
"['uplay', 'errors']",this game would be a thousand times better if i could just play the damn thing and not have to deal with uplay bullshit cant play the game and uplay wont send me the verification code to log in their shitty launcher goddamn udisoft just fuckin use steam to launch shit dont make me use your garbage fuckin launcher
"['assassin theme', 'series']",actually the best assassins creed game i have played out of like 6 of their games
['no topic'],buy it somewhere else it is not like a normal game it does not have achievements nor cards and you still need to run another launcher on top of steam so consuming 2 times the resources on your computer while it runs the game also still can 't get over 60fps on pc
['errors'],main story disables the game at 30 completion dont play the cove mission kenways fleet req ubi servers which is not supported anymore stuck at sea and cannot steer my ship only 30 hours in
['pirate theme'],pirates of the caribbean simulator 10 /10
['no topic'],it *s great
"['errors', 'full screen', 'uplay']",recent update ruined the game no full screen first ever crashes only after the july update don 't get the game right now fuck ubisoft
"['errors', 'uplay']",good game but i can 't play it on the steam deck because of the godforsaken ubisoft drm ffs ubisoft fix your game
['customer support'],i fucking love this game but the servers went down for like 6 weeks in november /december 2022 during this you couldn 't get past 20 of the singleplayer since it requires you to be connected to the ubi servers to play the fleet also i couldnt play the dlc however on the 15th of december 2022 the servers went back online so as long as the server support continues to exist the game is amazing
"['no topic', 'errors', 'uplay']",the game is fun maybe even a classic the pc port is a steaming pile of dog crap and nobody should ever give ubisoft money to peddle their garbage third party software they force on all of us in exchange for making their games unplayable piles of dog crap that requires additional bloatware just for me to experience the carnal pleasure of their games crashing my entire system every time i try to launch one
['no topic'],nice
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat']",assassin 's creed iv black flag is an awesome pirate game with a huge open world you play as edward kenway an interesting but cruel young captain with his ship the jackdaw you can go to the sea and be involved with naval battles or you can visit some little islands the story is captivating and the characters are well made the different swords and guns add more depth to the combat system and the combat itself feels more smooth the shanties are funny and the sea changes in many different ways it is a pitty they added again the tailing missions and also there are some strange checkpoints anyway start playing
['exploration'],great game for adventure and exploring one of my favorites
"['pirate theme', 'exploration']",dont buy this game for the story it sucks (for me i bought this game because of the pirates and the huge open wold with lots of interesting sidemissions
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'combat', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'character', 'exploration', 'music']",were you ever a fan of the pirates of the carribean movies the adventures of captain jack sparrow to become the greatest pirate of the carribean in his majestic black pearl ah the memories what 's more if being a pirate and plundering the carribean on your swift frigate by day is not enough you can be an assassin by night and carry on the legacy of the previous assassin 's creed games assassin 's creed black flag follows the main character edward kenway as he goes from a lousy pirate to a fully fledged assassin for the brotherhood the combat is very fluid and well -developed and the naval combat is surprisingly alright (besides too much smoke in battles personally i really enjoyed the 1700s feel of the game fighting with cutlasses and boarding other frigates and the occasional man o war i put let the pirates of the carribean theme song loose as i jumped from the rigging onto the deck of enemy vessels and started my rampage with my trusty cutlass and the jewel encrusted set of pistols the story line was excellent up until the very end where it unfortunately took a turn to a work of fiction and killed the immersion it previously provided however that negative did not outweight the entire game the game offers various clothing customization options which are nowhere as good as the dlc costumes you can acquire there is a fairly good selection of pistols and swords as well your ship jackdaw is also available to be customized you can fight soldiers assassinate some pesky targets run down some thieves board and capture military vessels and take on the role of jack sparrow ...literally...as you sail the high seas and make the carribean fear your name
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'entertainment value']",i 'm a big fan of pirates the glorified kind as real pirates weren 't all that based and held yikesy beliefs but this game is hecking awesome sauce if a woman asked me whether i 'd be a cowboy samurai or pirate i 'd say pirate not just because of one piece but because of this masterpiece of a game i played this on switch and when it was done i cried realizing the game was over was my 9 /11. very beautiful game 11 /10
"['pirate theme', 'errors', 'uplay']",this game is great overall a really fun experience from the moment you get your own ship you can pillage and roam the seas as a pirate freely until uplay erases all your data this happened to me like ten minutes in and i blamed my computer but then it happened with a 30 hour savegame and has ruined this game for me now as an addition it took me like 20 mins to start this game up as when you launch it from steam it opens uplay and when you launch it from uplay it opens steam again overall a great experience while it lasted fix uplay
['no topic'],fuck ubisoft
['storyline'],badass game with a nice story
"['storyline', 'character', 'combat', 'series', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",i have had a break since i have been re -playing through the assassin 's creed series i felt like a break was good because of how monotonous the layout seemed to get the more and more you played the previous installments back to back i would say the break did me good and coming back to this game it was simply amazing the controls felt a little more responsive but there is always difficulties it seems edward seems to wander sometimes and does not exactly follow what i 'm doing but everything else about this game has blown me away it is like they took the side quests of ship combat from assassin 's creed iii and made it an entire game along with the bonus of connor 's grandfather being a savage pirate assassin i absolutely enjoyed the jackdaw i will never get tired of coming back to this game just to shoot down a few ships the sea shanties are easily my favorite detail they added and makes me never want to fast travel edward 's character ark i loved and this game just felt so much more refreshing than the previous installments i would say this is one of my favorite games of all time and i actually really enjoyed playing it one of my favorites so far 9 /10
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'optimization']",it 's not a clone nor a rehash of other assassin 's creed games and therefore it really stands out pirating cool ship battles and lack of a convoluted mess of a story makes it really refreshing to play looks gorgeous too but won 't run well on low end cards happy pirating
['no topic'],pirate part of the game is sweet assasines creed part is lame uplay is like getting sodomized by santa claus to be specific playing the game requires absolutely no network problems with uplay servers or your game desyncs and you restart the mission or whatever uplay servers are constantly bad because they suck so you see the problem right they have created a closed loop of suckitude until uplay is taken apart and hurled into the sun there can be no peace on earth even origin doesn 't suck to the magnitude uplay does i was actually considering buying for honor and the new south park game until i reinstalled black flag and remembered why i stopped playing years ago fortunatly this is the only ubisoft game i own i think i am only out $30 or so avoid ubisoft games if you know what 's good for you
"['combat', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'exploration']",hands down one of the best games i have played in the past few years assassin 's creed 4 takes the whole franchise to a new level by adding an exciting naval combat system you never get bored of playing as there is such a varity of things to do combat is a little glitchy at times especially while boarding the story admittedly falls short and is lackluster compared to assassin 's creed 2 or even revalations graphics (provided you have a decent graphics card are stunning community challenges allow you to compete with the community in certain objectives which adds a nice competative element to the single -player. the naval combat and the many side quests and explorable areas more than make up for the game 's shortcomings overall amazing game that will keep you hooked for quite some time 9 .5/10
"['series', 'pirate theme']",awesome game for the ac franchise best pirate game i 've ever played also
['pirate theme'],pirates
['pirate theme'],личноя не очень люблю серию assassin 's creed но эта игра мне понравилась из -за темы пиратства .так что все кто жаждет пиратской романтики смело покупайте игру романтики там завались
"['no topic', 'uplay']",i love this game but i would rather have an unwashed catheter installed by edward scissor -hands after he has had his 16th cup of coffee than deal with uplay again the game gets a thumbs up uplay gets a thumbs down
"['storyline', 'combat']",the single player is pretty good the mp is horrible like usual
['series'],the best ac period forget what you heard its what you hearing
['entertainment value'],1 fun as hell 2 had a really good time playing it 3 overall try it yourself
"['optimization', 'series', 'combat', 'assassin theme', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'movement', 'music']",this game works fine i can 't vouch for the quality yet but the game works fine if you don 't think your computer is just a console with a keyboard you won 't have any issues ::::::update:::::::: i 've since put about 24 hours into it and i 've got a much better handle on the quality of the actual game it 's definitely the best assass game i have played but i 've only played the first ii and iii previously i was not a big fan to say the least this really feels like a departure from the first three games thematically and mechanically if you didn 't like the bulk of the previous games the climbing running jumping jumping off high things the fairly rudimentary combat of counter strike counter strike there is still a lot of that this time the core assass experience is very well broken up by a very interesting fun and surprisingly well realised naval game about piracy you aren 't the chosen one you are a pirate that through his ignorance and tunnel vision ends up embroiled in this existential battle it 's very easy to forget there are assassins and templars at all you are reminded here and there of course but you are free to go back out to sea looking for islands and having ship battles if you really didn 't get on with the other games everything you didn 't like is still present if you like ships and the sea and piracy and didn 't totally despise the ac experience you may or may not have already had it 's definitely worth a go things to keep in mind back up your saves regularly i lost a good 15 hours of progress to a 'damaged save delete or start new game which seems to have been fairly common the deluxe and /or season pass issue the basic edition of aciv on steam is entirely complete if we are talking about genuine content not piffle you won 't run into a part of the basic game where a dlc should be the genuine content in the deluxe and season pass is unrelated to the main game different stories different characters and started separately from the main menu so i would say for most people get the basic version you aren 't missing anything of note
['entertainment value'],loved this game so much it gave me aids just kidding thats gross seriously though this game is amazing
"['pirate theme', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'entertainment value', 'assassin theme']","a really awesome change up to the traditional assassin 's creed everyone loves pirates and if you don 't, well everyone likes pirates anyways graphically stunning with wonderful scenery on every island creating unique experinces every turn sail the high seas and battle red coats and black flags alike i really cannot say enough about this title to justify my enjoyment so just get it already $20.00 usd is right on par with the age of this game and should be looked upon with joy get this game a full price and live the life of some badass agile pirate that also likes to do some assassin like things"
"['no topic', 'storyline', 'entertainment value']",you know how an italian chef kisses his fingers and says something in italian that translates to 'a masterpiece after tasting their own dish that 's how i feel about this game
['no topic'],this game was perfect like skyrim where it didnt need a huge update or anything added they then did a 'patch update and it completely messed up the ability to play this game
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'series']","lets get the elephant outa the room this game is a masterpiece hands down it ’s a smart sprawling sequel that ’s very free and fun while trimming most of the fat that bogged down assassin ’s creed iii ’s ambitious but uneven adventure sailing across the massive expanse of the caribbean exploring gorgeous and unique islands and getting yourself into all sorts of swashbuckling trouble provide some of the most rewarding and memorable stretches of gameplay i ’ve experienced all year even after putting in more hours well after finishing the story i ’m still discovering new islands to explore and tombs to raid tropical locales and the amazing water effects on the open seas minimal loading and maximum draw distances that seem to go on for miles the way the camera zooms out when your ship reaches its maximum speed and the sunset turning blood -orange, is simply amazing black flag learns from ac 3 ’s initial 10 hours of banal hand -holding by immediately throwing you into the action after a lean and exhilarating opening mission that places you in the blood -soaked boots of connor ’s much livelier and more likable grandfather edward kenway the world blossoms and allows you to explore its vast uncharted waters the size of the world is staggering and the fact that it 's absolutely brimming with fun and rewarding activities made me want to get lost as possible as i traveled from point a to point b when you ignore the main mission prompt and simply set out in search of your own fun black flag is at its best it treats you like an adult and allows you to explore its gorgeous and activity -filled world to your heart ’s content want to discover every nook and cranny of kingston ’s sprawling expanse in search of templar secrets or would you rather buy a small fishing boat and hunt for all manner of deadly sea creatures using your spoils to upgrade your character maybe you just want to sail to a remote island climb to the top of a mountain and gaze in awe at the world around you black flag is all about embracing freedom and carving your own path through the world also the world ’s vast scope invites a handful of hiccups for instance the body of a guard who ’s holding a necessary key might disappear if you leave the area meaning that you have to restart a mission black flag is peppered with these sorts of annoyances and though they certainly aren 't deal -breakers, they had a tendency to pull me out of the experience a bit too often ubisoft wisely avoids the morose spaghetti bowl that assassin ’s creed ’s plot lines have become in favor of a much lighter tale that embraces the adventuresome spirit of classic pirate stories i loved the fact that edward is so unlike his assassin relatives and much more interested in the pursuit of money than the opaque goals of some secret cabal it 's a refreshing change of pace from a series that in 2013 had started to take itself a bit too seriously black flag also tends to repeat some of the assassin 's creed series favorite mistakes like forcing you to tail a prospective victim at a safe distance for minutes on end while you ’re given an exposition dump it ’s mighty annoying that i had to spend 10 minutes listening to rarely memorable dialogue before i could make the kill i would like to talk about the story in every detail but i must restrain myself from spoiling it unfortunately the story is just too good to explain to somebody who hasn 't played the game so i urge everyone to experience it for themselves tl ;dr: no doubt is the best assassins creed game and one of my favorite games overall an easy 9 /10"
"['storyline', 'exploration']",the campaign is just awesome lots of side missions and many upgrades for you and for the boat highly recommended but i dont know about online i just dont find it fun
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",i was a massive fan of the original assassin 's creed games and quickly realized that the series was bound to lose quality over time (as it did so when i picked up assassin 's creed black flag i didn 't expect a great assassin 's creed game and i didn 't get one matter of fact i think it would be a terrible game if it focused more on the assassin aspect of the story that didn 't really seem to fit the main character or the situation he found himself in all that well but while ubisoft may have given us a mediocre ac game with black flag it seems they accidentally created an amazing and beautiful pirate game the pirate story is believable the setting and maps are absolutely breathtaking as is the experience out on sea with the sound of waves crashing against your ship cannons and seagulls in the distance and your crew singing shanties as you roam the map in search of adventure if this game is on sale and you can run it i see little reason to not pick it up it 's easy to lose yourself in the beautiful world and story and i can 't think of a single pirate oriented game that can even reach the overall feel of this title tl ;dr: meh ac game amazing pirate game do get
"['entertainment value', 'character', 'storyline']",i am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single farther to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for christmas from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him loaded into the game made my character and world and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join loved it as it was the best time had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that there 's fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories
"['storyline', 'combat', 'series']",this is a very fun and enjoyable game especially for first comers to the series but it 's not the best assassin 's creed game the main focus is the naval gameplay which is an improved version of what ac3 had in fact black flag borrows many features from ac3 it 's just the setting that is more fun to play on the other hand hunting which was fun in ac3 was dumbed down and feels like it was thrown in the game just to be another check mark on the list of features you 'll spend most of the time sailing from one place to another boarding and sinking ships hunting whales and sharks diving to find treasures and capturing coastal forts the assassin 's part of the game is basically on the second plan even in the campaign story they could even have changed a few lines in the script and called the game only 'black flag in fact although light it fits well the series in the end and it took only five years to ubisoft to realize they could 've made a standalone pirate game by improving the formula they had in this game i 'm talking about the upcoming skull and bones to summarize very solid game but in my opinion ac2 and brotherhood are still the best in the series
"['combat', 'exploration', 'storyline']",really great game pros great combat great wepions great ship combat fun diffrent costumes fun mulitplayer huge open world good story 10 /10
['pirate theme'],many pirates such loot much plunder wow
"['uplay', 'no topic']",uplay i hope u burn in hell i bought the game from steam took a picture of the activation code and typed it in correct now it is saying incorrect code then kicked be from the uplay site for 60 minutes
['no topic'],$40 for a game that came out in 2013 should be a crime
"['graphics', 'storyline', 'music']",assassin 's creed black flag is an awesome game the graphics game play machinics and story were absolutly increadble the music in the game was awesome i felt like i was really in the game
['no topic'],no full screen shit should be illegal
['uplay'],u -play
"['errors', 'optimization', 'full screen']",last update broke the game sadly great game otherwise can not recommend as it is as the whole spiel of this game is immersion and gl getting that with windowed mode
"['optimization', 'full screen', 'entertainment value']",got a random update of 9mb loaded the game and now its stuck in windowed mode was having a lot of fun before this but its immersion breaking
"['assassin theme', 'series']",one of the best assassin 's creed games made
['no topic'],in a world without gold we might 've been heroes
['no topic'],you can 't really go wrong with this game just buy it and join the pirate community
['no topic'],mr gibbs any particular reason why my ship is gone
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'stealth', 'movement']",i am an old pirate who always looking for real (good) pirate games i bought this game because some players recommended this game to me if you didn 't play the stealth part the game only worth 50 -65/100. if you like a pirate game with some action it worth 70 -80/100 ***bad news ---if you want to finish this game or fully upgrade your ship you need to play like tomb raider action stealth some puzzle solving ---the 3rd person view setting is poor we cannot see what is in front of our ship .:steamsad: ---sword fighting is needed when ywe need to capture a fort capture a fort in order to expand our map viewing ***good news ---you don 't need to fully upgrade your ship to play the sea battles fight with small to mid size ships is still ok fighting with a battle ship will be hard ---the board fighting is good though we will get bore after sometime ---the sea battle fighting is also good sea wave thunder storm and gun smoke all looks good (i give them a credit to those parts the map is not very large but large enough ---some of the stealth missions are not so hard ---can visit and even do some looting to a town but can not capture it if you really don 't like stealth games this game is not for you but if the discount is really good it still worth a try
['no topic'],"for cd -key, right click the game on library then choose manage cd key"
"['errors', 'full screen']",update 2 crashes galore on radeon 7900 xt embarrassing update they fixed fullscreen finally and it only took 2 weeks my save games are still gone though good job guys \s ubisoft pushed an update to make this game unplayable besides being unable to enter fullscreen (that option is just gone and alt +enter does nothing the game freezes for me as soon as i gain control of edward i 've played this game to completion like 4 times and it worked great for almost 10 years why would you push a completely unnecessary patch that broke the game was it because you just announced a remake hmmmmmmmm this discussion section is full of threads complaining about this debacle immediately after the summer sale too you 're either greedy or incompetent i don 't know which is worse
['no topic'],kenway got a dump truck ass
"['storyline', 'frame rate']",despite a typically lazy console -port kneecapping the frame rate and resolution and the entirely unnecessary jarringly infused modern side -narrative black flag  finds itself the flagship and flagbearer of a time period and landscape notably missing from games and sorely needed in greater supply
"['movement', 'assassin theme', 'series', 'pirate theme']",still holds up extremely well even 10 years later movement especially the parkour can occasionally be frustrating but that 's about the only issue i can think of if you remember playing this when you were younger like the assassins creed series or just want a good pirate game this game is for you
['series'],hahaha abstergo is in montreal and so is ubisoft so ubisoft is saying they 're the bad guys it 's a very tongue in cheek reference hahaha
"['series', 'assassin theme', 'character', 'storyline', 'errors']",only 4 hours in probably have over 3000 hours on this game on ps4 goated best ass creed in the universe download or i will assasinate you irl because im shush444444444 mf 's i change my review still a really good game but i wasspamming pace to to skip all the intro shite and aparently if you press space on your save it instantly deletes it without warning so ye pretty sick just lost about 12 hours worth of progress
"['series', 'graphics', 'music', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration']",it 's the best ubisoft game but not the best assassin 's creed game as it deviated a bit from the formula it 's historical setting graphics soundtrack music atmosphere and gameplay is top -notch. the story is good but weaker than previous ac entries but it doesn 't matter as the main character is fun to play as the naval combat is extraordinary and exploration is very nice as well 10 /10
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'character']",loved it when kenway threw it back on blackbeard and started bussin it down sexual style

"['storyline', 'exploration', 'uplay']",i feel the game really picks up towards the end if you get the grinding done earlier so you can fully enjoy the story playing again after some years it still hurts and is enjoyable throughout some things to roll your eyes at but it really does hit you when it needs to continuing to walk the path only leaves you alone p .s. make sure to back up your saves the only reason i have 75 hours on steam is i was nearly done 100 %ing the game before uplay decided to delete my save
['uplay'],i do not recommend buying this game on steam as most likely you will not be able to activate the game thru ubi more info can be found here https ://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/144456/unable-to-register-game-to-ubisoft-account-ac4-black-flag-steam-cd-key?lang=en-us edit update 6 /30/22: the activation issue on steam was fixed

['pirate theme'],shanty flew away
['no topic'],for the voyage is long and the winds don 't blow it 's time for us to leave her
['pirate theme'],assassins aside this is legit the best pirate game out there
"['series', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'storyline']",the only reason i do not have a lot of playtime in this game is due to all the time i have spent playing it on console the game is the best ac out there without a doubt it ’s graphics can still be considered good even though it was released ages ago the open world pirate style this game has is amazing and capturing islands is one of the most fun and rewarding things to do the story is also amazing you start from barely anything and slowly grow in numbers and power i don ’t enjoy single player games that much but i loved this one and would replay it for sure
"['customer support', 'uplay', 'series', 'character', 'optimization', 'combat', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'pirate theme']",while i would like more then nothing else to keep the cute and wholesome nature of my yesterday 's review ubisoft spent the last few hours berating me slapping me up and down the street giving me a middle finger or two and calling me an a -hole for wanting to play the game i legally purchased years ago that got outta hand quickly sure did you see ubisoft is impossibly short sighted if you own the crew 2 another ubisoft title and want to change your character cause you find them ugly as sin well ...you'll need to literally delete your account unbind the game spend an hour or two trying to and failing to make a new account cause little did i know google chrome isn 't supported on ubidung 's site downloading a whole seperate browser literally just to make a uc account slap the unpaired game onto the new one and then you get to start a new game naturally that also means that you 'll have to either rebuy your other ub titles or go thru support and wait for them to finally respond and do that for you except i couldn 't. cause for whatever reason it kept telling me my saved password was wrong it wouldn 't send a password reset email to me no matter how many times i asked it to so i had to make another account just to get fking help to shift my legally purchased key from one account to another account and like ...idk...tell me why the hell i suddenly can 't get on my second account guys ...just pirate this game any company a -hole ish enough to slap a second drm onto a game is one that deserves to lose millions playing a legally purchased game should not cause migraines it should not be 50x more difficult then just stealing it out right but here i am literally downloading a full cracked version just so i can by pass fking ubisoft 's garbage launcher so i can play the freaking game i purchased on steam years ago ...how pathetic is that this is easily the best assassin 's creed game ever it 's the only one i 've ever cared about and the only one i keep coming back to there 's something romantic about roaming the seven seas on a pirate ship and one of your mates breaks into song <3 the shanties keep me coming back to reinstall if that isn 't a game well done idk what is ~<3
"['storyline', 'combat', 'stealth', 'music']",this game was the sh @t when i was a kid and i loved playing it on the xbox 360 back in 2014 however replaying the game again on steam i have to say that it was not as good as i once remembered for starters the tailing missions are a pain (although an expected one and the combat though visually appealing is pretty simple you can easily pull of counters and tank gunshots making it possible to kill 10 -15 enemies without even taking a single hit it makes it easy to learn but as you keep playing it gets old fast the stealth in general does not work too well in this game leading you to depend on combat to get around i 'd say the only parts that lived up to my nostalgia is the killer soundtrack and naval combat fighting off 2 frigates in the middle of a storm dodging waterspouts will always be fun i can only really recommend this game to casual gamers and i don 't mean that in a bad way because the repetitive objectives and missions can only entertain you for so long so as long as you pace yourself with how much you play you can enjoy ac black flag
"['storyline', 'stealth', 'assassin theme', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",this game is great and up until odyssey its my favorite ac game the stealth missions are a bit scarce and actually hard because you rarely do them the golden part of this game tho lays in the fact that you can be an actual pirate
['storyline'],up until the last memory of sequence 1 the game is pretty boring but then it gets interesting
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'music', 'combat']",this game is amazing it 's map is really big and fun to explore the story is great and i cried a little at the end (idk why the music and naval combat is also really good i 'd recommend this game to anyone

"['storyline', 'character']",finishing this game has left an empty hole deep in my soul a void that cannot be filled thanks ubisoft </3 edit for the serious review this was my first assassin 's creed game i really liked it even though i am new to the series i didn 't feel lost at all because they introduce you to concepts like the templars and assassin 's and the sage (etc) very gently the characters and stories are so rich and i love how much character development edward goes through it feels really realistic and not rushed at all like it can be in some games edward is a protagonist that you come to love so much that it genuinely hurts when the game is over i think the only drawback in my opinion (other than a couple of really frustrating optional objectives here and there was that some cosmetic upgrades for edward and the jackdaw were no longer unlockable since the community challenges no longer take place i suppose thats just something that comes with playing the game for the first time 8 years after initial release
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'entertainment value']",i thought i heard the old man say 'leave her johnny leave her tomorrow ye will get your pay and it 's time for us to leave her leave her johnny leave her oh leave her johnny leave her for the voyage is long and the winds don 't blow and it 's time for us to leave her oh the wind was foul and the sea ran high leave her johnny leave her she shipped it green and none went by and it 's time for us to leave her leave her johnny leave her oh leave her johnny leave her for the voyage is long and the winds don 't blow and it 's time for us to leave her i hate to sail on this rotten tub leave her johnny leave her no grog allowed and rotten grub and it 's time for us to leave her leave her johnny leave her oh leave her johnny leave her for the voyage is long and the winds don 't blow and it 's time for us to leave her we swear by rote for want of more leave her johnny leave her but now we 're through so we 'll go on shore and it 's time for us to leave her leave her johnny leave her oh leave her johnny leave her for the voyage is long and the winds don 't blow and it 's time for us to leave her johnny left her 0 /10
['pirate theme'],you get to sail the caribbean to raid pillage and plunder as a pirate what 's not to love
"['series', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics']",hands down one of the best ac titles out there the introduction of naval battles to the ac formula is seamless and fitting given the context pirate theme is also very fun and interesting storyline is compelling enough to drive the game forward while gameplay mechanics are the best they 've been the one downside is the uninteresting modern -day storyline which interrupts the momentum and immersion from the main story
"['errors', 'uplay']",my save file is lost i have to start the game from 0 this happened after the u -play/ubisoft connect change thing
['no topic'],what sea of thieves could have been
['series'],the best assassin 's creed
"['assassin theme', 'series']",one of the best old style assassin 's creed games
"['assassin theme', 'optimization', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",this game is the most re -playable assassins creed game i have ever owned in comparison to how other assassins creed games handle mechanically on computer this one is by far the smoothest as well being able to have an open world pirate game that plays and looks as good as this one does is fantastic i highly recommend this game to anyone wanting a open world pirate game
['storyline'],good story
"['graphics', 'combat', 'stealth', 'storyline']",amazing game with great art lighting and gameplay the best gameplay in the entire ac series naval battles create hours of enjoyment while plantation raid test the player 's stealth the story is amazing as well sometimes might seem tedious or dull at very few parts the dlc especially freedom cry is absolutely amazing would recommend this to anyone
['storyline'],best chapter
"['pirate theme', 'combat']",explore the west indies it feels like a real pirate also the naval battle was very addictive
"['storyline', 'combat', 'optimization', 'series', 'graphics', 'customer support', 'cloud mechanics', 'animals', 'exploration', 'character', 'movement', 'music']","black flag is not only an assassin 's creed game it 's a fully realized pirate game it 's made by ubisoft so there are some bugs i have encountered only two sometimes when you fast travel somewhere your ship can spawn upside down the other one happened when i jumped from the top of the church in havana and i fell on the road but it didn 't deal any fall damage to me the plot is really good and you can start playing the series with this one because edward kenway (the main character isn 't relative to the assassins from the last games you will meet a lot of people during your journey you will even meet blackbeard the gameplay loop is just amazing i would say that i don 't like the tailing missions because they are the same mission but just at a different place the combat is really well made the hunting is really simple but it 's а mandatory part of the game there is a crafting mechanic it 's not complicated at all it 's actually really simple if you have enough ingredients you can craft it and you don 't need ridiculous numbers usually it 's 3 or 4 items you can upgrade your ship but you need crafting materials for some of the upgrades you can plunder enemy ships for materials for the ship upgrades ships can reach a board state aka they are so broken that they can 't move then you can decide if you want to sink the ship or board it if you sink it you don 't receive anything if you board it and you win the board battle you can do three things with the ship you can use the ship to fix yours lower your wanted level or send that ship to your fleat the fleet is a minigame it 's a turn based rpg battle and then you can send one of your ships to trade materials for money the optional stuff are shanties fragments chests treasures forts viewpoints man o wars mayan stones templar hunts assassin 's contract (i don 't know if i missed any you collect shanties to unlock more songs for your crew to sing while you sail the fragments are just collectibles you can open chests left on the map for money you find a treasure map and then you go and dig out the treasure the forts are massive castles in the sea you can take over them and it will reveal the map in this part of the world viewpoints are basically radio towers man o war is a giant ship mayan stones are collectibles but when you collect all of them you get a special outfit templar hunts are tailing missions and assassin 's contracts are hitman missions there are more but i can 't recall all right now the soundtrack is amizing my favourite one is the main theme i really like the shanties though you can 't choose what shantie your crew will sing and sometimes i want to listen to the drunken sailer but the crew won 't sing it overall i think this is the best assassin 's creed game and i 'll give it 9 ,5/10 because of the bugs reused missions and the unaccess ability"
"['pirate theme', 'series', 'entertainment value']",i haven't played that much of this but wow its fun i don't have much experience with the assassin's creed series but i enjoyed this game alot i love how when you sail across the sea your crew sings sea shanties i highly recommend this game
['no topic'],haha boats
"['storyline', 'graphics']",assassin 's creed iv black flag is arguably not only one of the best assassin 's creed games but perhaps even open world games i have played so far for a game which is going on to be 7 years as of writing it still feels like a fairly well polished product with any faults or bugs either being innocuous and sometimes even funny the caribbean as a setting works incredibly well with many activities locations and objectives with not a single boring scene from the vibrant scene of havana to the ancient runes left behind on small islands and finally the graphics still hold up to scrutiny even after so much time has passed
"['assassin theme', 'series']",one of the best assassin 's ever made when i first started i didnt know where to start 100 worth buying in 2020
['entertainment value'],i simply love it
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",i am very late to playing this but highly recommend it it 's too similar as the other ones duh but has enough 'new' mechanics and /or scenarios that warrant praise
['no topic'],so nostalgic and still feels great playing
"['entertainment value', 'graphics']",yesss sooo much fun recommended for anyone and everyone lots more gameplay and things to do than most triple a games these days and graphics and everything else has aged really well
"['optimization', 'frame rate']",the game is really good except when i come back after a year to visit the game its 1 fps in the menu screen and i can barely run the game even when i manage to open my save apparently you need a really good computer to run this game
['no topic'],good game 10 /10
['errors'],i can 't play since it requires ucan 'tplay
"['storyline', 'errors', 'optimization', 'combat', 'graphics', 'customer support', 'exploration', 'character', 'series', 'entertainment value']","huge briliant pirate game does have a few issues though my worst was when i had to shut down halfway through a mission sequence 04 memory 02 and when i went back the main mission icon was gone saw many suggestions online but the one that works is sail to 70 ,405 and when you enter the bay you are back on tulus and the main mission it is very simple if you know this there are loads of less important glitches that negative reviewers can focus on but otherwise the game is awesome and very addictive upgrading your pirate happens early and not much point in visiting the shop except to get ammo and buy skins which saves you having to hunt for them but the jackdaw is another story that you have to work for your upgrades and they are well worth getting not that sure about the fleet part of the game almost feels like an add -on without much point but maybe i just prefer a more hands on type of game as a pirate game this has got to be one of the best and certainly the best i have played so on that basis alone i highly recommend buying it parts of it i give 10 /10 and other parts 6 /10."
"['storyline', 'combat', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",*i have to say that this review will contain major spoilers so don 't read it if you don 't want to spoil anything thank you assassin 's creed iv black flag an a assassin 's creed game that had change my life and view for ac games forever you 'll start the game as edward a privateer that went to the sea for a vision of better life for his wife and himself but the things will start to fuck up straight from the beggining and your ship where you serve as a privateer will sink to the botton of the caribbeen sea after killing a traitor /rogue assassin duncan walpole you 'll cooperate with a merchant the name is stede bonnet he 'll help you get to havanna and from there you 'll try to continue to do a contract that traitor assassin was supposed to do you 'll take his name and as 'duncan walpole you 'll will continue helping torres spanish governor after some main missions he 'll discover that you 're not duncan walpole and he 'll send you somewhere in chains on a ship which is part of 'treasure fleet you 'll meet the quartermaster adewalé a former slave and the journey can begin the journey of plundering you 'll meet blackbeard james kidd jack rackham charles vane ben hornigold and all of your other friends and enemies that will flip the story upside down the story is funny emotional and heartbreaking at the end i 'm not gonna lie i cried at the end when i finished the story for the first time that song at the end 'parting glass got me i definitely recommend you to play this have fun with the opportunities in the game there is a lot of content in ac :bf. collectibles legendary ships assassination contracts naval contracts etc the game also contains better naval combat which was improved from assassin 's creed iii and i 'm happy for that i didn 't like the naval combat at all in ac iii but it 's so much fun in black flag it 's better in all ways and fun to experiment with i give the rating 15 /10 to this game i loved the story the opportunieties the content and all of the funny combat (naval and fighting with sword and pistols hidden blades and stuff like muskets axes (these are the weapons with can only be taken from an enemy and cannot be added in your inventory anyways this game was great and i enjoyed it i also completed it on 100 completion which you can see right here https ://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=722379095 i hope this review helped you decide and have a good day
['no topic'],very good game i love it
['no topic'],multiplayer is still fun tho
"['character', 'series', 'exploration', 'animals', 'music', 'pirate theme', 'storyline']",it 's hard to imagine how connor from ac iii has no charisma since he 's grandson of edward kenway a very cool guy and a character that makes you want to play more and more to know everything about him and he is the main character of a perfect game black flag like ac iii gives you the freedom to hunt animals all over land in a bigger map but is more than that you also can hunt whales and sharks this is awesome you can spend hours just sailing and hearing the shanties this time the story has more fantasy details but the piracy system works perfectly and again this is not an 'assassin's creed game just has the name the dlc it 's way more loyal to the assassin 's order and adewale really is an assassin different from connor and edward who are just themselves but edward is way more charismatic and fun to play the game presents iconic pirates like 'black beard 'anne bonny 'mary read who in the start posed as james kidd an illegitimate son of the late william kidd in order to facilitate her career as a pirate and is fantastic how the game was able to develop all this characters and more in a very curious and so fittable in just one game 10/10
['no topic'],when ubisoft still making a good game
['entertainment value'],enjoyed every minute of it a must buy
"['storyline', 'pirate theme']","best game of the world sad ending for me i wanted a better ending with all his family blackbeard ,'james kidd etc .i actually wanted him to marry 'james kid if i remember corectly her real name is mary sorry if i have bad english best game of the world"

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'movement']","awesome game .the naval battles esspecially .fluid running ,cool storyline and a ton of side -missions.at least 50 hours of gameplay and still stuff to do"
"['storyline', 'assassin theme']",i have completed the story and i am close to doing every single thing in the game my personal favorite of the assassin 's creed on pc i recomend it unless if you don 't like the whole boat driving thing if you don 't i suggest assassin 's creed iii thanks
['no topic'],good game
"['storyline', 'series']",loved the story it is probably the most unique ac game to date just because you can captain a ship and do as you please in the caribbean the story had a bunch of twists that i couldn 't anticipate i won 't expose any spoilers but expect to grow with the protagonist as we did with ezio auditore it 's that 'coming-of-age' from boy into man 10 /10 one of the best ac games to date
['no topic'],this is the best game
"['uplay', 'errors']",you shouldn't buy this game or any game with uplay a legitamite game and haven't been able to play for the last couple days because of uplay tried to install update to no avail long story short uplay can suck a d **k
"['combat', 'progression', 'naval']",loved it all the naval combat is great fun and i felt a sense of progression from upgrading my ship
['no topic'],its really a nice game 4 /5
['no topic'],so asome game so asome game
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'series', 'entertainment value']",a really good game i have completed this 100 still want more lol graphics are stunning to say how old the game is not to mention the map is huge with lots of side missons /adventures to have this is the best ac in my opinion buy buy buy
['no topic'],my boat disappeard then i could dive in a water hole left behind when my boat was gone 10 /10
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'graphics', 'optimization', 'exploration', 'character', 'entertainment value']",this is undoubtedly the best assasin 's creed game yet and i 've played and beat them all assasin 's creed iv black flag feels like a revitalization of the franchise it is truly a remarkable experience set in a caribbean atmosphere and centered around pirate lore the game has numerous addictive qualities that keep pulling me back for more sailing the high seas in conquest and search for treasures never gets boring upgrading your ship and battling ever increasingly difficult numberrs of foes keeps you on the egde of your seat the graphics and sound here are truly spectacular and without taxing your computer hardware i really can 't recommend this game enough if you enjoyed any of the previous assasin 's creed games or haven 't played them but have an interest in pirate lore this game is an easy no brainer get it now and enjoy the adventure because games this good only come along once every few years i 'd give it a 10 out of 10
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",an assassin 's creed game really has no right of being this good
['no topic'],pros +you can hire 'dancers' +you can stand on turtles +you can harpoon sharks cons -this game makes you shoot monkeys to upgrade your gear
"['optimization', 'graphics', 'series', 'pirate theme']",had issues with stuttering but once i forced triple buffering game runs well and i like it a lot .pirating sea missions give a good twist to the ac series
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'stealth', 'combat', 'pirate theme']",lengthy and detailed single player storyline lush visuals great balance between stealth and combat sequences you 'll feel you 're a pirate (ahoy!)
"['assassin theme', 'series']",this game is the pinnicle of the assassins creed series
"['series', 'character', 'exploration', 'difficulty', 'graphics']",note i haven 't completed the game yet i 've been a long time fan of the assassin 's creed franchise for many years and black flag seems to be my favorite of the series to play however i would have to say that edward isn 't my favorite as it has to go to ezio in ac2 anyway this game has a ton of places to explore side missions to complete and it 's just damn fun as of now my only complaints are the endless amount of grinding to upgrade your ship and the annoying tailing missions graphically the game is beautiful at max settings overall this game is great and i can 't recommend it enough go buy it
"['series', 'storyline', 'exploration']",love this game i must admit that i only started playing ac seriously once revelations came out so no i 'm not some hardcore fan who has 100 hours on each game except for ac brotherhood where they have 200 what i can tell you is this is by far my favourite ac game so far honestly if you are into the sea and this certain time period and you have a bit of cash i would highly recommend it for people who want to get into ac and just don 't know where to start i would say there is no need to go all the way to ac 1 due to the fact the main story is completely new so you 'll be just as surprised as all the other players
"['series', 'storyline']",just for fans the game didn 't introduce something really new to the franchise the naval battles aren 't enough to give some fresh air to the game the story walks in the same way as the last games of the series maybe just for the fun of vsiting some beatiful enviromets could be enough to play this game i 've played for as long as 40 hours and yet can 't find any empathy or simpathy with the main character by the way i 'm a fan of the series and for this i preferred to wait for a price drop it didn 't attracted me enouch to adquire it in the first day like the ac iii
"['series', 'pirate theme']",best ac game and marvelous sailing experience
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'optimization']",this game is fun pirate ship goodness with assassin creed flavor runs a little slow on the port at times but this one has been patched to be more friendly to the pc gamer if you hit periods of lag google some fixes they exist
"['graphics', 'gameplay', 'storyline', 'character', 'series', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",wow just wow this game is amazing the graphics are beautiful and gameplay is smooth as it has ever been the story is great and you don 't have to play half the game to play the main character *cough* ac3 although ac3 was my first game to play through all the way i must say ac4 is way better new items weapons and just more badass stuff goes on in the game and did i mention the map take ac3 's map and times it by 10 i have so much more to do in the game and i can 't wait totally worth the the 35 bucks i spent on it and would absolutely spend 60 on it
"['assassin theme', 'series', 'entertainment value']",one of the best games i have ever played the best assassins creed game ever there are so many aspects to dis game i freaking fucking love it buy it
"['series', 'character', 'combat', 'exploration', 'storyline', 'pirate theme']",i love the assassin 's creed series and this is the best one yet it does a great job of taking historical figures and making them into vibrant characters with whom edward can interact the sailing /naval combat portions of the game are also well done traveling between locations almost always felt like an adventure rather than a chore one of the few downsides of the game is that several of the mission types (such as eavesdropping missions become repetitive collecting sea shanties was surprisingly fun i even thought the usually boring out -of-animus portions of the game were fun (and rather meta in this game
"['pirate theme', 'movement', 'storyline', 'series']",avast landlubbers pirates creed 4 is without doubt the most fun creed game so far its just a shame that about 7 games in and they still can 't get the freerunning to be smooth doesn 't matter though since you basically just spend your time sailing aboot terrorising the west indies its sort of like sid mieirs pirates but instead of a dancing minigame there 's an assassin 's creed minigame that you occasionally have to do
"['storyline', 'combat', 'pirate theme']",first of the series i got into but i must say what a great place to start fluid gameplay decent story line and a ton of pillaging and plundering
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'series']",i 'd heard and seen some very good things about black flag but was not quite prepared for this return to form for the assassin 's creed series without hyperbole this is pretty much as close to a perfect game about piracy as the gaming industry has had since it began ubisoft montreal have really nailed the feel of the open waves with your crew singing sea shanties and yelling out to you about incoming ships or men overboard for a game about a vast open ocean there really is a lot to explore and do from hidden treasures to taking down forts and legendary ships once you hit land however it is the same old assassin ’s creed running rooftops and trailing people to learn about and assassinate them you know the drill but this time there is the itch to go back to plundering which the game is only to glad to scratch the weird alien future story really doesn ’t come up that much and there is a quite a bit of meta based humour and self reflection to it overall it feels less shoe -horned in than in previous games in the series brilliant stuff a true turn around
"['graphics', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",awesome game with great graphics and story one of the best open world adventure game ever 10 /10
['no topic'],this is the best game ever
"['optimization', 'cloud mechanics', 'uplay', 'series', 'graphics', 'assassin theme']",well sync cloud lost my saved games the only bad thing i can say about it best since ac 1 and 2 9 /10 full review here http ://fg-2.com/2014/04/14/review-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/
"['assassin theme', 'series']",this is by far the best assassins creed ever i encourge everyone to buy it sooner or later
"['storyline', 'pirate theme']",this is a great game that i will recommend to just about anyone the best part is that you can get away with skipping through most of the franchise and still enjoy this game edward kenways roll and personality tends to be more appealing than conners in ac3 fun ship battles and a great story to follow with plenty of things to do on land and sea the diving missions are beautiful and and great addition to the game play so go check it out
"['pirate theme', 'exploration', 'series']",loved the mechanics of the piracy on ac3 and wished there was more s much more ac4 delivered just in the beginning but the potential for the franchise just keeps open for more and more as long as they explore it well recommend this game (and most of the others as well but bias as i am a fan to any rpg /adventure fans out there
['no topic'],best game ive played as of 12 /12/2013!!!
['pirate theme'],finally a good pirate game i 'm so happy
"['series', 'assassin theme', 'storyline', 'entertainment value']",this game is amazing i play assassin 's creed game for first time i play assassin creed iv i recommended this game
['entertainment value'],on the whole quite fun but also quite repetitive good for at least 40 hours of play
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'character']",really lovely open world brilliant story and lots to do you could never feel bored of all there is to do in the world from useful hunting minigames to naval contracts there is also a large array of upgrades to edward (protaganist) and his ship the jackdaw the characters in the story really make the game though and by mid way through the extencive story i became very attached to the characters causing the game to have real depth hope this review was helpful f0rce
"['assassin theme', 'series']",omg the best game about assasins this is really better than ac1 ac2 ac3
['entertainment value'],amazing game just i <3 it
"['assassin theme', 'graphics', 'stealth', 'exploration', 'combat', 'storyline']","black flag is the best assassin creed part ever ,graphic is much beter the stealth too the island add more intrest into the game the naval combat took a big part in the game also the story line are great rated with 9 .5 /10"
"['storyline', 'graphics']",i could never explain how awesome this game is for its few far in between and tiny hiccups they matter not very engaging beautiful and for those who couldnt get into aciii i understand why but this game will definitely salve that burn the franchise left you
['errors'],i have spent a day on the playu and still can 't play it however after applying a cracked patch i think this game is good enough
"['no topic', 'combat']",incredible game a really good change to the usual formula the ship combat was amazing
"['pirate theme', 'entertainment value']",hours of fun sailing the seas absolutely recommend this game
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",the best ac game ever made

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'series', 'graphics', 'uplay', 'customer support', 'exploration', 'character', 'movement']",the assassin 's creed series was never my type of games i actually never really all enjoyed the series with the exception of the first but this is an effing pirate simulator (or as close to one as you can get while the game never takes away the copy paste element of all the other assassin 's creed games this one has a much more tollerable experience if you like pirates and simulated games black flag has stunning realism in the ocean sailing there are strangely fun events to partake in and loads of ships to sink destroy or board while you do still do the traditional island hunting stalking hawk diving assasinating of traditional assasin 's creed games it 's a bit more free roam therefore it will not force you to continue the story line if you just want to kill some whales and blow up ships upgrades for your ships and crafting elements are apparent in this one i 'd say black flag is one of the best top notch assassin 's creed games released so far on pc expect some framerate dips if you aren 't running a brand new $1000 rig but it 's not unplayable expect some frustrations with controlling your charecter without a controller as well i 'd strongly reccommend a pc controller for this game it will make movement on land (with all the traditional assassin 's creed 's mechanics and sailing your ship far easier none the less assassin 's fans will have a different viewpoint than myself as not -so-much a cult follower of the series to another assassin 's fan get it to a non -assassin's fan like myself it 's worth at least finding a friend that has it to try it you may be impressed perhaps you 'll get it on sale never beat the game and roam the ocean like i do i 'm pretty pleased with the sailing myself then again i always wanted to be a pirate rrrggg 4 .0/5 for an assassin 's creed game 4 .5/5 for a pirate simulator i 'd pay $30 for this game anyday not sure if i 'd really pay all that much more for it though happy sailing
"['series', 'assassin theme', 'stealth', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'uplay']",this is really awesome game as a part of ac series and as a pirate simulator it 's up to you how to play (though mostly you 'd prefer stealthy way as a silent assassin or as a crazy pirate i didn 't liked ac 1 and 2 not my type and i would have skipped this game just as i skipped ac 3 but playing as a pirate really hooked me up and after a first mission i was so astonished by the game so i 've played several hours in a row (though it 's hard for me to find so much free time i won 't tell you anything about story you should see it yourself go buy this game p .s. don 't be afraid of uplay it 's not as bad nowadays as it was few years ago
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'storyline', 'series', 'graphics']",ac4 is a monumental pirate experience in the west indies as your open world the freedom to explore plunder and adventure to your hearts content is an unforgettable and thrilling experience the main character edward kenway is definitely welcome to a now ever extending line of assassins in the ac franchise and i guarentee you 'll love him on the flip side the story has several ups and downs and the modern day detracts the atmosphere of urgency the other games had regardless it 's a very solid game and redeems some of the mistakes of ac3 9 /10
['no topic'],amazing
['errors'],i dont know what was i thinking purchasing a ubisoft game damn these summer sales and your irresistable discounts huge fps drops from the first moment into the game and then it crashes consintently at a point 50 min into the game basically unplayable will be getting a refund recommend to stay away from this broken garbage
"['uplay', 'no topic']",this game doesn't work unless you run uplay in offline mode
['no topic'],this game is great
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'series']",ok so let me preface this by saying something that fans of the franchise won 't like the assassin 's creed series is just stupid i played the first and didn 't think much of it the second was alright but then i lost complete interest after that with their convoluted storylines and recycled game mechanics ubi continued to march out their yearly cash machine and i was amazed at how they seemed content to just keep making the same game over and over again then black flag happened now up to that point sid meyers pirates had come pretty close to being the perfect pirate game and people always had that to fall back on if they felt the sudden urge to scream 'arrgh matey while gaming with the release of black flag the perfect pirate game had been accomplished and what was infinetly more important was that the ridiculous assassins storyline had been abandoned for a classic pirate tale (albeit one where edward kenway just didn 't give a sh !t about the assassins or templars and just wanted to do some proper piracy as far as having to give the game a score to reflect my feelings about it i would say half point deducted just for being an assassins game (it should have just been a new ip called 'black flag and it could have been the new yearly milking machine on its own and another half point deducted just for that stupid immersion breaking 'lets go back to the game developers office for the most galactically stupid side story ever sequences leaving it with a solid 9 /10. the naval warfare and ship boarding alone could have been it 's own game but with everything else it was the magnus opus of the assassins creed series then they went back to being stupid again for the following 4 games life is weird eh
"['combat', 'storyline', 'errors', 'graphics']",having played most of the assassins creed series i am quite used to it but this game is just so much better than the rest the combat is awesome (infantry and naval and there are some really good elements to the game such as recruiting pirates taking over other ships and then choosing what you can do with the wreckage of the ship repair destroy and so on this really does add to the game in an awesome way there is a couple of problems involving minor detail for example the death animations of the guards and enemies are broken for example you kill a guard near a wall and his foot goes through the wall playing the death /execution animation after you have killed him and in order the the corpse to ragdoll it need to go in to the ragdoll physics in the ragdoll physics you will see that the foot has got cought in the wall and makes the guard glitch out it 's amusing to see but kind of annoying at the same time over all i rate it 8 /10 because it is awesome but not perfect thank you for reading my review
['pirate theme'],i like the parts where i am a pirate
"['entertainment value', 'exploration']",it 's a surprisingly fun game i did not expect to have this much fun with an open world game tbqh buy it
"['pirate theme', 'series', 'combat', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",yes yes yes you must play this if for any reason that you love pirates this is by far the best in the series and i havent finished it tho but im enjoying it very much 8 sea battles on the boat is fun the sending convoys out at sea is fun the combat is fun all of it so far for me has been fun and lots of freedom like in ac1 for the most part 8
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'combat', 'exploration', 'graphics']","sail ahoy comrade acivbf is the 1st ac that i want to finish quickly aside because i want to finish because witcher 3 is incoming the game itself is kind of stray from the line of the creed to wrap the story , it 's about a man that dreams big about adventure and get rich fast so he sail to the sea to become pirate while leaving his beautiful wife behind all to find the plundering as a pirate that he was doing is wrong and he lost his way at the end the assassin 's creed made him realise that he was wrong and help him back to his way and don 't forgot his daughter come to meet him so he really realise that he 's wrong and try to become a good father happy end  it 's better to name this game a different title the story is not about assassin 's creed at all it 's about pirate and plundering while adventuring meet the assassin 's creed and templar while i complain about the story and the concept the gameplay itself is fantastic all the pirate game that i have played this is the best so far it got adventure sailing ship diving parkour and don 't forget rum but there isn 't any woman that i can have a way with (lol). to wrap my review this acivbf is a nonconsistent game while the gameplay and the graphic is good the story and the concept is stray from the line of the creed so for you that following the ac series this game somewhat explain a little what happen after aciii but the story itself is not really good and for you that haven 't play the ac series this game should be remember as a pirate game not an ac series **spent so much time in this game as a pirate than an assassin (lol)**"
"['uplay', 'errors']",requires connection to ubisoft connect which doesn't even work so the game is literally unplayable
"['pirate theme', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']","i love this game going around sailing under the black flag is one of the coolest fealings you can get in a game if ye be seaking adventure look no ferther ye have girls ,glory,adventure,and booty awaiting you ......and carple tunle from playing this game so mutch ya its that fun"
"['graphics', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'optimization', 'combat', 'uplay', 'errors', 'movement', 'customer support']",this game was very fun graphics are incredible it used a lot of the new features that nvidia has displayed the story plot is good displaying interesting characters and unexpected twist plot and you can sail on a boat and control a fleet that was so nice i used my ipad to manage the fleet which was a really nice touch you need a very good computer to play the game with full details if you like to collect things this game won 't disappoint you there are tons of little things to collect so sad achievements are not handled by steam i hate ubisoft platform but that is the way you have to play it i used an xbox controller ant it works flawlessly i suffer a couple of bugs once in a while when you use fast traveling since the ship emerge from the bottom of the ocean sometimes the character gets trapped i played the game for a long time and only happened it to me like 3 times in summary this is the first assassin 's creed game i start playing and cannot stop until i complete it i hate that i have 98 of the items but the map doesn 't help me to know where is the missing 2 i will recommend this game even not to fans of the franchise
"['storyline', 'errors']",i enjoy the game i love the sailing aspect and i love the music but i cannot in good faith recommend this to others due to the bugs and glitches you encounter on the regular and the dodgy ai that is sometimes ridiculously stupid and sometimes omniscient from missing character models during cutscenes to glitched geometry it 's everywhere i expected something better from a triple a game and my first ac title but i suppose that was more hope than i should have afforded i will still play the game solely for the enjoyment of sailing other than that the game is as bland gullible and easy as its main character
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'series', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']","arguably the best assassin 's creed game and a very fun pirate game on top of that builds on most of the mechanics of the previous games while also fleshing out some of the half finished ideas from assassin 's creed iii (hunting, sea combat etc and making them actually fun and useful the story is good edward 's journey is a good one the writing and voice acting are all well done and there are some memorable characters the 'ground' gameplay is very much more of the same assassin 's creed that your 'e probably already used to if you are considering this if you weren 't a fan of stabbing dudes climbing to viewpoints parkouring all over the place etc then you probably still will not enjoy this part of the game it 's not challenging really but it 's fun the sea combat is surprisingly good cannons are all handled well (and you have quite a few varieties your ship can be upgraded with better armor cannons new types of cannons etc you can board or sink ships take their treasure or commandeer them for your fleet (sort of like the brotherhood 'minigame' from the previous games well done and very fun sailing the high seas is made even better by the sea shanties you collect for your pirate crew to sing there are quite a bit of side objectives to complete some old and some new assassin missions collectables and chests are all still present new challenges include harpooning whales naval battles and capturing forts (sort of like capturing templar bases in the older games i 92 %ed my save and it took me about 40 hours i imagine it 'd be about 50 if you wanted to 100 it maybe a bit less i was a fan of the modern components of the previous assassin 's creed games even though i understand that a lot of other people were not a new tangent of the modern story is present in this game and it 's handled in a slightly different way if you were not a fan there 's probably 15 -30 minutes of 'modern' gameplay that you are forced to do and the rest is optional if you 're into the series /lore, there are a lot of different tidbits you can find that relate back to previous games future games etc pretty cool overall great game highly recommended even if you haven 't played previous assassin 's creed games and even more so if you have and liked them"
"['series', 'combat', 'storyline', 'optimization', 'graphics', 'customer support', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",my favorite assassin 's creed since 2013 i recently decided to play the steam version i bought a while ago still holds up to this day it has some bugs sure but every ac has bugs great starting point too because this is the first assassin 's creed game after the desmond era a soft reset in the series not a hard reset like the recent open world ac games i should also state that this game is more of a pirate game than an assassin 's creed game the game focuses more on being a pirate ship to ship combat and hunting whales or sharks playing rogue after this and hoping it will be as fun or maybe even more dlc the dlc is fun but it really is just a dlc adewale 's story is short but fun it also takes place after the main game aveline 's story is just not it it 's only 3 sequences and doesn 't really add much to the ac4 game i 100 cleared everything except the multiplayer but i guess that 's dead anyways really recommend if you like pirate games and a great story 9 .5/10
['no topic'],yeah it 's good
['pirate theme'],pirat gam
"['storyline', 'uplay', 'pirate theme']",the story game play characters soundtrack visuals sound design quest and mission quality and immersion are all top notch however you have to put up with ubisoft 's connection software which if you are like me got locked out of in short this is why people pirate games and you know what ubisoft in this case you deserve to lose every red cent to internet pirates for the garbage you attached to an otherwise nearly flawless game it 's because of ubisofts crap connector that i have to not recommend this game go pirate it instead
['uplay'],have to put in an activation code for a game i already bought but the ubisoft servers are 'unavailable' for no reason stupid cunts
['no topic'],sheesh
['pirate theme'],it 's a pirate 's life for me
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",best ac ever
['no topic'],you can no longer step on rats
"['errors', 'customer support']",whats the point of selling a game if you cant even activate it ubisoft support is just trash read the boards everyone who bought this cant play
"['pirate theme', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'music', 'entertainment value', 'character']",i just set sail today and a beautiful playful whale reared up from the surface of the ocean to splash water over my ship who knows what joy tomorrow will bring this game is still so beautiful and delightful even after all these years i actually returned for another play through after originally playing it almost a decade ago yet the graphics are still as gorgeous as most games released nowadays you get to play a pirate named edward kenway in the west indies aka the historical caribbean during the time period around the 1700 's. if you love pirates this is probably the best game ever made for experiencing pirate life it has everything you would expect and more from great climbing parkour sword fights looting hunting for buried treasure naval battles and sailing around to mysterious and uncharted isles not to mention just being able to set sail while listening to the crew sing authentic sea chanteys was very immersive also a great game for people who might be interested in sea of thieves but want a game with more realistic graphics the game captures the allure of being a pirate while also conveying all the risk and freedom of that exciting lifestyle it also offers a huge open world to explore a nice story and interesting characters well they are pirates after all so one might expect nothing less arr matey
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'combat', 'optimization', 'series', 'graphics', 'customer support', 'animals', 'stealth', 'movement']","listen here fucker this right here might be the ultimate open world pirate experience if you are struggling to chose between the über maximum stupid abhorrent absolut piece of garbage that is sea of thieves and this immaculate divine piece of art jewel of the crown do not doubt in any moment in choosing assassin 's creed black flag i can 't put in coherent words my hatred for sot everyday i feel filthy and scammed for playing that horrendous joke of a sandbox but to cleanse my pupils for watching and playing that kind of eldritch horror and after playing it for the first time in 2013 when the original release came out this pirate story just comes in handy it purified me it revived my hope in sea exploration in sot you enter a session and you only have your ugly ass sails and skins or whatever for your ship which varies in size depending on your party making a solo play totally unbearable also you have your 'skill', something repetitive about mastering the use of a very short range of guns and swords and useless things in contrast there 's a history in ac4 which follows the adventures and redemption of a character that almost anyone can identify with whereas in sot there 's just quests that pass as something of a story line filled with yarr and stupid shit like that in ac4 not only you get to keep your skins which are crafted from materials that need to be obtained by sailing the beautiful caribbean sea and sinking from little boats to legendary war ships you always have your own ship with a predefined size that becomes a character in it 's own story a vessel that can be upgraded and used just to the limit of the skill of the player at first you might only sink little gunboats and in a blaze of glory and after gathering the required materials to upgrade your cannons mortars ram and hull sinking your first man o war and the reward that comes with it just feels amazing there 's something simple to master but highly profitable at some point in the story once you unlock the kenway fleet money just ain 't a problem anymore if you keep an eye on it almost ten years ago on my first gameplay i never pay enough attention to this 'trading' system but this is where the grinding struggle is eradicated and boarding tons of ships makes sense at first you have to be aware of what 's happening between movements and the fleet status but once you unlock more and more routes pay gets higher and time between actions differs this system isn 't mutually exclusive with other ways of obtaining money it 's just a faster way to achieve a decent arsenal for you ship in any case you don 't have to wander around the sea looking for skulls just to travel to the other end of the world to exchange your wasted hours of gameplay for just a couple of gold coins there 's monkes jaguars panthers and a whole other lot of animals to hunt and make upgrades to your equipment from them there 's a crew and a deck officer in your ship that evolves around you there 's collectibles that reward you once you get a determined amount of them there 's sea shanties there 's sea animals hunting there 's shipwreck carefully crafted that probably will trigger someone 's thalassophobia where you can collect blueprints for ship upgrades there 's iconic locations and beautiful scenery and landscapes there 's multiple cultures there 's an iconic stealth system there 's multiple forms of tackling an objective there 's multiple way of combat tools customizable to accomodate one 's style of fighting there 's bar fights there is a lot of things in ac4 that sot lacks and maybe ac4 lacks some of sot content but to be honest ac4 is far superior even without those features simply you can get most of the few enjoyable experiences of sot in ac4 but not the other way around sot wishes to be just a little fraction of what ac4 is and it forever will as that anyway fuck you sot fuck you carlos fuck you rust and fuck you rare lost all my respect for the company buy it and if you can buy freedom cry and liberation dlc just to spit and stomp over the ugly face of sot even more"
"['graphics', 'exploration', 'storyline']",i used to play this game on my ps4 it was fun and graphically very pleasing back then now i have a gaming pc that can run games on 2k and the graphics has never been better for me before double price and no regrets at all roaming around islands is a true pleasure i know when it comes to ac franchise it is always arguable which one is the best one which has had better fight mechanics etc this is the one for me this is the one in every aspects damn ship fights were driving me crazy back then but once you get used to it you 'll definitely enjoy it after this point i am telling a little irl story somehow related to this game and you may skip if you are not interested in it what is also sad and also happy at the same time for me is to find the island a bit away from south shores of haiti called île -à-vache in the game i have been in haiti 4 times on different business trips and have been on this island for 2 days once damn that nature i couldn 't forget it was like no -one's lands a few houses and a boutique hotel owned by a weird french fella (port morgan was the name of the hotel if i remember correctly and that 's all on the north side of the island on the south shore there were some bungalows and that 's it i have enjoyed my 2 days there trully the most peaceful moments of my life the ocean the silence the weed from their very own soil beer i should have been died there i should have been buried there and i found that island in this fucking game when i am deeply missing that place i used to log in to this game and sail my ship to île -à-vache and chill when i was on my ps4 damn those memories and forgetting everything about this damned world
"['errors', 'uplay']",it would be great if the game was playable however ubisoft connect is unable to function at all leaving you locked out of the game

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'uplay', 'series']",this entry in the ac franchise is the least focused on assassins versus templars as it is essentially just a pirate simulator albeit an incredibly fun one the naval combat is second to none and the sea shanties are also incredibly catchy and you will find yourself singing alongside your crew it is for this reason that this is the casual fan 's favourite ac game the gold edition is the currently only version available on steam but is the one that i would recommend even if the base version comes back to steam it includes amongst other things 2 separate dlc campaigns one of which is only available on playstation (aveline) and the other is sold as a standalone game on steam as well (freedom cry both of which are much shorter than the regular base game but are still a lot of fun this is the last entry in the ac series that has pvp multiplayer but the multiplayer is dead it was never a great mode and the series is better just focusing on the campaign mode anyway some proverbial housekeeping this game 's system requirements are actually quite higher than what is officially listed unfortunately this game does require uplay there are uplay achievements and at the time of this review all uplay rewards are automatically permanently unlocked for all steam ac games the game supports 21 :9 although it is bugged and requires a very simple game file edit although even an idiot like me can do it in a minute
"['storyline', 'uplay', 'combat', 'optimization', 'series', 'graphics', 'customer support', 'movement']",i never write reviews because i find them to be useless when the reader only reads the most liked one but when it comes to this vile game and its company i found it necessary i got this game +the majority of the dlcs during the summer sale so it was worth virtually no money biggest pro immersive scenery and naval /ground battles other pros none biggest con uplay /ubisoft is absolutely abhorrent other cons you need a good computer (that's kinda given for an open world game it gets repetitive with the completion you can get the highest level swords and pistols very early making you very overpowered but if you want to get 100 percent completion you have to go back and purchase the weaker weapons even though they have no use to you the multiplayer portion is dreadful it 's sad that this game has dlcs in which their main selling point is that you spend less time playing the story is disappointing the game is way too easy with the exception of side quests which are a hit or a miss on whether they are challenging or not the movement system is rigged some of the missions (like the stalking ones are so boring and long that i was able to speed run skyrim and still have time left in the mission the under water swimming mechanics are appalling the dlcs the aveline and adawale dlcs weren 't that bad ironically they were part of the few redeeming qualities of this game unless you 're planning on grinding the multiplayer or care about how your character or ship looks like in game or are planning on playing the game for less time for some reason none of the other dlcs are worth the money why ubisoft makes me want to break some random lady 's glass china and what forms the deciding factor on why this game isn 't worth your money so i am a perfectionist and like to fully complete games so much so that in this game even after completing the story i went back and completed every side mission bought everything on my house and made sure to (almost) complete every mission but then i saw these missions where you have to find social chests and social events and stuff like that so i do some research and find that you need to wait patiently for some random dude to play the inactive game from 2013 and find one for you or add a friend and tell them to find it for you this is all in ubisoft 's scheme to increase their player base so i 'm like 'no biggie i have other stuff to do in game i 'll just wait until one pops up but then the mfing servers go down which means that social chests cannot be shared at this point i had completed everything but the social chest achievement so i had nothing else to do so i waited playing other games but still checking daily if the servers were back up nope they were down for 7 days i don 't even know if they ever came back up as i gave up looking and decided to just wallow in my sadness of being unable to complete a game that was at 99 completion but all that ended today i decided to load back in and check on the servers i had finally passed 99 completion you know why these mfs at ubisoft deleted my game save so now there is nothing left except disappointment and wasted time this game really makes me not want to buy any other assassins creed (ac) game especially when i hear that this one is the best if you 're going to buy an ac game please do it when it 's on sale they are not worth it at all while full price or even better don 't buy one at all

"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'exploration', 'combat', 'character', 'series']",this review is part of a series so it is more of a comparison to the other games rather than an individual review play time 40 hours story 11 /12 the story is absolutely fantastic the characters and arc of the protagonist are some of the best of the ac franchise edward starts off as a ruthless pirate who only looks out for himself and gradually learns to fight for something bigger the ending of his arc is great and possibly the most emotional ending of all the games it also introduces a lot of cool lore such as the sage (although this and the ending of the game are never even mentioned again in future ac games setting 10 /12 free -running through the streets of venice was a blast but sailing on the open seas looking for treasure while your crew sings a shanty is arguably just as entertaining finding hidden coves and pirate dens full of loot adds a great deal of entertainment to the game combat 9 /12 this game affords you a lot of options in terms of combat pistols are much easier and more fun to use than in ac3 the sword combat and finishers look great and you also have some unique abilities as well missions and side activities 10 /12 many of the main story missions are pretty straightforward the collectables are very entertaining to find as you sail from island to island looking for them upgrading your ship feels very rewarding although raiding other ships gets a bit repetitive toward the end the stronghold sieges are also a great addition to the game and we don 't really see anything else like it until valhalla assassin 9 /10 edward is simply a great character he might not be the classic assassin you 'd expect but at least you could make an argument that he is an assassin unlike the two most recent games (odyssey and valhalla he has a great character arc and a sharp tongue that dispatches sloppy drunks and pirate hunters with ease overall rank 11 /12 black flag was a drastic change to the ac formula really taking the series out of the classic era for good and starting a new path entirely although it is almost nothing like the previous games it is still incredible

['pirate theme'],piracy is pog
"['series', 'assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",best assassin 's creed game best pirate game
['storyline'],very good game best creed ive played 100 recommended great storyline
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'music']",best in the series dont fucking come to me with the bullshit that it is any other game but this one and here 's a quick fire round best soundtrack best open world gud story but best gear best enemies and ships best progression with the ship and weapons and for fuck sake 's it has the best soundtrack in the history of games and i swear if you fast travel like the cuck you are then you are a mistake in society considering you dont listen to the good old sea shanties and should be hung by the neck and i cannot stress this enough that i would have never bought this game if it weren 't for the amazing soundtrack props to brian tyler for he 's amazing work and may he continue to deliver such good music
"['series', 'exploration', 'character', 'graphics', 'combat', 'storyline', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'customer support', 'cloud mechanics', 'animals', 'full screen', 'entertainment value', 'movement', 'music']","assassin's creed black flag   intro assassin 's creed iv black flag it 's probably my favorite ac game (between previous games of the franchise the only one that i feel that could match up to it is assassin 's creed ii brotherhood i like ezio and italy a lot but honestly black flag feels more open world exploration plus it 's set in the golden age of piracy (caribbean sea and you get to play an awesome character as well edward kenway both him and ezio are my favorite so far in the series edward is father of haytham making him grandfather of connor (ac3 protagonist pros: open world featuring kingston havana and nassau that look great plus an huge sea to explore with a lot of islands and events besides the hunting feature from ac3 you can now harpoon sea animals awesome outfits to collect and craft you can have 4 guns to shot plus duel wielding naval fights got improved plus 4 legendary ship battles and ocasionally you can hunt royal navy convoys for extra gold conquer forts with your ship some of these battles are great one definitely comes to mind with a storm around a fort as you battle it improve and customize your ship jackdaw naval combat rewards such as sending the ships you win in battle to a new feature called 'edward's fleet where you can send your fleet on missions to get rewards a little bit like the assassin 's creed brotherhood assassin 's system where you send them to collect stuff for you exploration underwater bar fights storywise it 's interesting keeps you hooked to keep playing it even though i did a lot of the exploration before even moving on with the story besides that it features many historical figures such as benjamin hornigold jack rackham anne bonny charles vane and edward thatch portuguese are involved the animus system is now different you control first person character (which is yourself in the abstergo entertainment company and you explore dna based memories from people like desmond clay and so on (even though they are dead abstergo has their samples and you can now use them to explore ancestors memories as an abstergo research analyst collectibles both in -game and outside of the animus system tons of chests fragments and treasure maps to collect play as aveline and adewale on dlc perfomance is great plays and runs so smoothly full sync missions weren 't so tedious as in previous games hack computers in abstergo no mini -games achievements cons: multiplayer honestly it 's ok to have it but those multiplayer achievements such as level 55 and a few annoying others can take a lot of time and effort there 's not a lot of players around to play games to get these (you can just do them agaisnt bots but a few of the achievements have to be done in pvp i 'm glad i managed to still get them though got lucky with the sacred land achievement as well as any other ac game there 's a few bugs got 2 that made me reload the game one got me beneath the enemy ship as i was boarding it (though, this was on freedom cry dlc and the other one beneath an island and couldn 't get out freedom cry has even more bugs there was a sound issue as well can 't hear the clash of the swords didn 't really like playing it edward 's fleet missions take a lot of time at least the last one 's, had already completed the game had to come back just for it final verdict  if you 're a casual player getting in ac franchise and wondering where to start your journey you could do it here on black flag but then going back to previous game 's won 't feel that great as they are more clunky and buggy unless you start from there either ac1 to get the full desmond story or ac2 if you feel ac1 is too outdated (even though i think it 's worth to give it a shot too the game is awesome addicting definitely worth buying wait for a sale anyway as you save quite some money enjoyed this game from the start until the very end it 's a good 60 hours or more of content"
['no topic'],brilliant buy now
"['errors', 'uplay']",unfortunately i can only recomend this game on a platform other than pc uplay is just too broken and utterly terrible to the extent that i can 't actually activate the game
"['pirate theme', 'exploration']",the vibes you get from this game is incredible if you like pirates and the new age along with some adventurous action you should definitely try this game
"['no topic', 'storyline', 'assassin theme', 'exploration', 'character', 'stealth', 'movement', 'entertainment value', 'pirate theme']",the only ac game that matters all else is hogwash don 't buy this game because parkouring across buildings is fun (it's not don 't buy this because you care about the over -arching story of templars vs assassins in the future /past (you don 't). and please friend don 't buy this game because you think context -sensitivity is smart gameplay (press a to win buy this game because you 're an f -ing pirate sail the salt sea as your crew sings chanties harpoon whales and dive with sharks explore ancient ruins on jungle islands casually dispatch enemies by the dozens as you board their vessel this is the best pirate game by a long sight (the story excluding the animas portions is fairly good the characters are likable and well realized and the voice acting is superb but damn those animas parts of ac games have to go
"['pirate theme', 'graphics', 'optimization', 'storyline', 'entertainment value']","come all you young sailor men listen to me i 'll sing you a song of the fish in the sea i 'm sorry i got lost in the moment and what a moment it was ac :blackflag is in the list of my top 20 best games of all time in fact the game is so good i will beg the world to buy it (no, i am not getting paid by ubisoft my rating 10 /10 pros graphics (absolutely amazing from realistic oceans ships day &night lights every little details is to die for gameplay (hats-off ubisoft you have pretty much nailed it the controls are so well optimised such a smooth gameplay story (very engaging and kept me intrigued the side quests weren 't bad either there is a real sense purpose here overall (i cannot recommend it enough it 's got amazing graphics cool upgrades and really beautiful sights /locations to explore the sense of satisfaction you get after wrecking enemy ships alone is worth the money cons none"
['no topic'],i bought this game i don 't regret it
"['entertainment value', 'series', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'graphics']",a lot of people say this game is good and a lot of other people say this game isnt good i think this game is fun see how i wrote fun in capital yes this game is a lot of fun most people buy games and finish it quickly i am not that kind of a person i finished ac iii in 2 years by taking breaks and doing most of the side missions getting the assassins in my crew etc and i had so much fun doing those stuff i also finished ac ii brotherhood revelations those were a similar experience but this is gameplay if we look at the story ac ii was the best in my opinion right now i have spent 11 hours into ac 4 and i am at 13 i dont do main missions frequently i think i am in the 3rd sequence right now in the 4th memory i just roam around and find mayan stuff upgrade my ship attack ships etc right now im trying to get the armor that needs 4 keys so i have a lot to go right now the story is going excellent about the graphics i play this on a laptop so i am not able to play this on the best graphics but even on low graphics i think its slightly better than xbox360 i hope this helped and if you are an ac fan just like me buy this game
['series'],the best game of all the assassin 's creed games
"['storyline', 'combat', 'movement', 'assassin theme']",one of the most moving and motivating games that ubisoft has ever released black flag is unlike any of the other assassin 's creed games that they have released although while they do kinda have the same combat and movement mechanics this game 's storyline is quite unique in it 's own way as you make your way as being a bad ass pirate and assassin and has a very good stimulator where you can control your own ship and go battle in the sea with amazing experience the storyline is jaw dropping and if you buy the gold edition you get to play as adewale won 't give any spoilers there but the storyline where he and kenway had left is one no one should be left out of tldr you get to be a pirate
['pirate theme'],buy it whether or not it 's on sale it 's a fairly generic assassins creed game but you aren 't buying this for ac you 're buying it for pirates because this is by far the best pirate game in recent history it looks beautiful plays amazingly tonnes todo and a large upgrade section to keep you busy for a while
"['series', 'combat', 'storyline']",this is the same assassin 's creed you 've played before with pirate trappings the ship combat is enjoyable and upgrading your ship is a fun way to get your leveling up fix if you 've never played the series before this is a decent place to start but i 'd suggest ii or brotherhood they have better mission design and a much more engaging story
"['storyline', 'combat']",this is really a great game good story and good batlle from me bay this game you will not regret
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'storyline']","who doesn 't love pirates who doesn 't love assassin 's? who doesn 't love brutally murdering your foes on the open sea 's? if you said me to any of these questions please leave the store page for ac iv black flag right now having played every single game in the assassin 's creed series i can say with all honesty that the gameplay feels almost the same as all the others with small little additions that are hardly noticeable with the exception of edward 's ship the jackdaw this game can be compared in combat and free roam with most of the other assassin 's creed games however we all know that most of us buy from the assassin 's creed franchise to enrich our minds about the history and story of desmond miles and now moving on from **spoiler alert his death in ac3 this continues to subject 17 in the eyes of edward kenway you 'll notice that edward is not like most of the assassin 's, which proves for an incredibly refreshing plot and storyline and i can 't say i was bored at any one point in the game yes some may call me an ac fanboy and i probably am but i know friends that have picked this up to be their first assassin 's creed game and have enjoyed it thoroughlly great game and can 't wait for more to come"
"['storyline', 'difficulty', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",the very best assassin 's creed game out there so far easily 50 hours of gameplay on singleplayer if you 're a completionist like myself there is a lot to do and you won 't bore yourself out very expansive and seamless gameplay there 's so much to do and you 'll get side tracked from the main storyline easily which isn 't a bad thing everything is fun and has differences in difficulties not everything is too easy or too hard tl ;dr vast content seamless gameplay many things to do play in your own style you control the game 10 /10 (considering the genre previous assassin 's creed titles gameplay
"['pirate theme', 'graphics']",ภาคน ี้มันส์มากอิอิ เน ื่อเรื่องใหม่ เก ี่ยวกับโจรสลัดถือว่าสนุกเลยครับ กราฟฟ ิค ก ็คล้ายคลึงกับภาค 3 แต ่ความมันส์ยังคงอยู่
['no topic'],its ersome
"['errors', 'uplay']",this fucking shit required uplay which doesn't work do not buy this shit ....you waste 5 euros
"['storyline', 'combat', 'series']",tremendous fun and addictively easy to play the shift to the carribean and the emphasis on naval combat could have been a huge mistake but they absolutely pulled it off largely sidelining not only the modern storyline but also a great chunk of the templar vs assassin plot in favor of just playing as a pirate captain trying to get rich was absolutely the right idea while these plots do come more to the fore as the main storyline goes on edward kenway has charm as the protagonist that unfortunately connor in ac3 did not making everything far more palatable i can absolutely recommend this if like me you got burned out on the series with the previous game it has revitalized my interest
"['pirate theme', 'exploration', 'combat', 'series', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']","ahh assassins creed black flag this game is a beauty whether you are an history geek or just wanted to take the controls of a pirate ship this is the game for you you are able to sail all over the caribbean from havana kingston to nassau crooked island fsx offers a comprehensive range of weapons from military swords to pistols the game also offers a range of missions beginning with 'beginner' missions right through to 'advanced' missions there truly is something for everyone 10 /10, i recommend to all"
['no topic'],best game in my life
"['storyline', 'optimization', 'exploration', 'series', 'combat']",verdict 95 assassin ’s creed iv represents a significant and rewarding experience in its own right it takes all the elements that the franchise has excelled at and has placed them within an open world environment which instead of the roads and cars of the gta series sees the use of a simplified naval simulation it is a compelling mix and the game packs a significant increase in content to other games within the franchise my only minor gripe is that some cut scenes become repetitive but that doesn ’t affect the overall game experience at all it is a heady mix and a real adventure which after over 30 hours of gameplay i ’m pleased to say is only 50 through multiplayer is beautiful a real change from the deathmatch mayhem which most games produce instead a thoughtful and intense game of cat and mouse replaces the gung -ho team death match pros its still assassin ’s creed naval combat open world compelling gameplay cons cut scences get repetitive
"['combat', 'assassin theme']",looking to hack and slash some templars well i guess you 're looking at the best game to do that then
"['uplay', 'customer support']",have to use ubisoft connect to play and ubisoft sucks
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'stealth', 'character', 'series']","assassin's creed iv black flag  is the first time i 've played a game in the series since ac iii , which was a very mixed bag i feel like black flag  was a much better game overall and ubisoft definitely upped the game on the ship mechanics i hated the ship sections in ac iii  but this game cleaned it up and made it interesting to combat on the open seas edward kenway your playable character is just a pirate at the beginning but he gets pulled into the assassins /templars mess when he finds a dead assassin on an island most of the game is still about being a pirate though stealth is a necessity after various times throughout the game the sights are awesome all around and the sound is pretty relaxing when you 're living this pirate life and part of that stems from your crew the crew you create through out the game (and essentially the fleet of ships you start leading is great the characters are pretty interesting altogether and i think this game has one of the better plots when it comes to dealing with this many characters if you were interested in earlier games in this series instead of the new style that ubisoft went towards i do think this one is good to play"
"['uplay', 'pirate theme']",warning dont buy this game u -play essentially is playing a game of russian roulette with the barrel trained right at your save game 7 hours 24 hours 100 hours u -play dosent give a shit because one day you 'll press play and your ship your crew your treasure --will all be gone so way to go ubisoft you 're king of the pirates but all the rum in the world wont wash away the bad blood you 've just established between most your fans
"['pirate theme', 'combat']",11 /10 would play again conquered a stronghold with 6 ships on my ass and a storm raging

"['graphics', 'soundtrack', 'gameplay', 'storyline', 'combat', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'exploration', 'character', 'series', 'customer support', 'cloud mechanics', 'animals', 'full screen', 'entertainment value', 'stealth', 'movement', 'music']","the graphics soundtrack and gameplay are great and it runs well even on my measly intel 4000 integrated graphics the story falls a bit short unfortunately not only because of the writing but also because it 's easy to get distracted by side activities until you can 't remember what was going on anyway and probably can 't be bothered to care either that said it 's not bad if you don 't mind a more fantasy -oriented ac game with a lot of focus on mythology and stuff but it 's not exactly the most captivating piece of ac storyline i 've ever seen the game runs smoothly even on my laptop (yes, i 'm playing this on a laptop sue me and i haven 't encountered any bugs either (apart from the occasional sword phasing through some of the outfits but i have yet to see a game where that doesn 't happen the parcour pathfinding is no less aggravating than it could be in previous games and there are some climb -able things it really hates such as a few parts of mast and rigging as well as the occasional tree fluidly running over rooftops and the like works good though if you can find enough rooftops to run over that is you don 't need to constantly hold down three keys (forward, sprint and freerunning anymore only two you only need the third one for jumps deemed 'unsafe' by the pathfinding which is definitely an improvement hand -to-hand (or, well sword -to-sword) combat is okay but neither particularly hard nor terribly exciting very satisfying though and it looks awesome naval combat however is fluid streamlined and just plain fun once you get the hang of it the only thing that is probably even more fun than naval combat is sailing the different weather conditions are beautiful to watch (look out for high waves during sunshine the color of the sea when the sunlight shines through the waves is a very nice and very pretty touch if occasionally slightly aggravating (hello there super -dense fog and intense storms with unfortunate timing but ah the things you gladly suffer for a bit of realism the ship handles very nicely too and the level of texture you can see even while sailing is incredible (also, bonus point for sea shanties dangit ! best thing ever although the soundtrack if you deactivate them is glorious too win /win.) i don 't know if i 've mentioned it yet but the game is stunningly beautiful very detailed very nicely textured and well made with a very clean intricate and atmospheric look if you 're anything like me you 'll probably end up climbing sync points more for the looks than for anything else especially because the map is a good deal less integral to you finding your way around than it used to be the only thing that i don 't like about ac4 is the amount of wasted potential asscreed needs a more captivating story than ac4 has and as much as i love it as it is it probably would 've been the game of my dreams if they 'd just made a pure pirate game out of it and expanded on the pirate -y parts of it the assasin parts of the game do feel a bit tacked on every now and then still i don 't regret spending money on this it was totally worth every cent of it and i can full -heartedly recommend it it may not be a perfect game but it is a very very good one"
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",one of the best assassin 's creeds i love sailing the open seas and encountering ships with bad guys gah so fun
['no topic'],this game is piles of horses poo brought the game in deluxe edition and played for 3 days after that update came and all cdkey they gave me didn 't work now i can finally say fuck ubisoft am done with your fuker

"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'exploration', 'combat', 'series', 'optimization', 'movement', 'character', 'uplay', 'graphics', 'customer support', 'music']",this is hands down the best assassin 's creed to ever see the light of day not because it 's an assassin 's creed game but because it is an assassin 's creed game wrapped inside pirate simulator 2013 i liked sid meier 's pirates and this game takes the concept to a whole new level there is so much to do pros sea battles you can board ships you can capture these ships and send them to your fleet you have a fleet which incorporates its own mini game you can send our fleet 's ships to mission to gain resources and money but first you need to secure the trade routes by doing mini sea battles you can go whaling and kill sharks you can explore islands from tiny to huge in size and kill the local fauna for resources you can find things like smuggler dens and dive to sunken ships to find treasures and treasure maps i'm not quite sure on this yet but it seems like you can assault whole cities and take them for your own . correction you can assault several forts and if you manage to destroy them with your cannons you gain control over a section of the map i e no more 'red zone and collectibles appear upgrade your ship upgrade your character neutrals tons of collectibles and unlockables love them or hate them you need to progress the story to be able to do everything listed above cons at its core it 's still an assassin 's creed game that of course doesn 't automatically make it bad but uplay very sticky and at times sluggish ground movement your character constantly tries to grab on to or step on any possible thing he can find chasing something better jump on some random post and and squat for a few seconds instead of just running on the street like a normal person as soon as you step foot onto any roof you will be hunted by ten or more guards who want to stab shoot and generally murder you in cold blood for ...being on a roof silly bugs but nothing game breaking for me so far
['series'],one of the best ac games

"['storyline', 'errors']",on the one hand the game is great on the other hand there 's a major bug concerning save files and i 've lost all my progress twice with no official help available as good as those first 10 hours are i 'm not going to keep banging my head against a wall
['errors'],the game simply doesn't start the quick fixes didn't work refund
['no topic'],i love this game but it 's honestly so disappointing it can 't be played on a full screen like for what reason is it not full screen if you can i would purchase on the console instead of steam it makes a difference in game play t n t
['no topic'],best ac game of all time
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'music', 'series']",old but gold <3 amazing story line epic sea adventures and locations fantastic music and shanties aside from all the ac series this one is a masterpiece beyond compare despite being an old title
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'combat', 'optimization', 'series', 'exploration', 'character', 'uplay', 'graphics', 'customer support', 'cloud mechanics', 'entertainment value']",this game is actually incredible with the exception of a little bugginess this game is really well put together it has all the elements of a great game fans of the series plus games like x it takes the original winning formula and adds in this system where you go around in a pirate ship and blow other boats up for supplies to upgrade your boat and make it more awesome so you can blow up even bigger boats and then it adds in this kenway 's fleet minigame thing where basically after you blow up a boat (mostly) you can add it to your fleet the missions take like 10 hours in real time (they go when the game isn 't running and you get money from them and they unlock new missions and stuff it 's just awesome and then you get your own island which you can upgrade for better stores and perks around the world and then it unlocks a series of side quests that tie into the main questline where you save assassins or something but it adds them to every city so you can go back and do these side quests that are each like 4 missions in length it 's just great i don 't want to go outside until i finish it basically and that 's going to take forever because all i do is sail a boat and blow stuff up instead of doing quests

"['storyline', 'graphics', 'music']",one of the best games i have played to date i love the open world concept coupled with the rich and diverse island locations the stunning graphics and orchestrated music combined with a deep storyline deliver a very intense game immersion well done ubisoft two thumbs up

['no topic'],главный герой наконец -то не ходит как макака со сколиозом /10
"['storyline', 'graphics']",this game is great but i noticed that switching to a new computer made it so slow it was nearly unplayable anyway i love how you are able to do whatever you want between chapters of the story but also slightly limited this game is just great even with how the graphics of games are now in comparison to when this was released (only seven years ago but the graphics of ac games and games in general have improved significantly this game will always be my go -to game whenever i 'm feeling like obliterating some guards or sailing the seas
['pirate theme'],it 's still best ac game for me i can relate myself to kenway i love naval action and sailing it 's also best pirate game around still recommend in 2020
"['uplay', 'customer support']",game was ok uplay is not unless you enjoy having a metric ton of unnecessary garbage installed along with the game creating a separate account just for this game then working through support to recover access to your game after reinstalling steam and not remembering username /password. and yeah the garbage it installs does not go away after you uninstall the game you have to root it all out separately it 's just a game but acts like it 's some critical service provider seriously ubisoft
"['pirate theme', 'graphics', 'series', 'optimization', 'entertainment value', 'frame rate']",f*ck the assassins it 's the pirate simulator ! what will happen with assassins creed if you cut all that boring assassin templar missions and add to it deadbeat main hero which many of us can relate amazing graphics piracy casual gameplay and we will get undoubtedly successful game only add to it 4 to intrigue already dissapointed players after ac3 and we get assassins creed 4 black flag game with such great unique atmosphere and looks amazing it 's not assassins creed 4 but just ac black flag serves as spin off to a ac3 this game is so good and friendly to newer players so even if you not played ac games before you can play this be a pirate sink ships get booty spend reals and get rich with edward neverlasting greed i don 't see the point to spoiler anything about this part i 'll just say this game most likely will be likeable to everyone because it 's nearly perfect buy the gold edition all dlc will be nice if judge only by the title assassin 's creed this part is the best if not it 's just a most succesful game i 've seen from ubisfot along with far cry 3 true assassin 's creed lies from 1 -3 in chronological order btw someone may experience lags and low fps idk why and how it can be i can say only i had nvidia card which is fit for minimal settings for ac4 but i had hardly 27 -30 fps on minimal settings in big places now i have amd it 's 30 -50 fps on maximum settings and set your aa settings to fxaa because higher it cause problems good hunting
"['series', 'entertainment value']",just a fantastic game all around i love the ac series but this is by far my favourite i just completed my third run of the campaign which if you know me is saying a lot as i will usually only play a game through once an all around great game which i recommend heartily
['no topic'],i got the controller working by going to the controller icon in the library page for the game and changing the mapping to gamepad ive discovered that if you open task manager click on aciv and set affinity and turn the last core off and back on it fixes everything no stutters anymore keeping this negative tho because i shouldnt have to go through the headache of troubleshooting a game i just bought

"['no topic', 'entertainment value']",before i played this i had a small penis no girlfriend and no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty good
"['pirate theme', 'entertainment value']",always wanted to be a pirate this game nailed it greatly recommended

"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",horrible assassin 's creed game aside from jack kidd but an amazing pirate game it 's the kind of game i 've been wanting for years the visuals are also stunning and the voice acting is pretty good too also for being a pirate game it 's pretty accurate too though it does fall to one or two pirate tropes in the single player but otherwise an awesome game
"['entertainment value', 'exploration']",i am obsessed with this game it is huge there is so much you can do it never gets boring or tedious just due to the crazy amount of activities you can do doing the dives gives me pretty big anxiety though the sea creatures really freaking me out all in all i love this game i never usually buy games when they 're new and $60 and i 'm so glad i took the risk and got this game totally worth the time i 've put into it so far and the money i spent i would recommend it to anyone

"['errors', 'full screen']",same problem as everyone else the full screan bug that i know can be fixt but also have the lunch problem the game won 't start after re downloading :/
"['storyline', 'music', 'combat', 'entertainment value']",marvelous work very captivating story with some great characters the sound and music are nothing but amazing would stay on the sea just to listen to those shanties combat and treasure hunting are entertaining and well built but will get repetitive after a while so ''so if it 's fortune and adventure you seek then this is the game for you
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",the best pirate game ever with the mix of assassins and templar war its even more better
"['optimization', 'frame rate']",well to make things clear game is great but physx is terible its totaly broken on my gtx980ti it kills framerate 1st thing u will do (if u plan on playing 60 +fps) turnoff totally physx not joking u can have some 4sli futuristic gps and u still wont be able to hit 60fps with that thing running
"['uplay', 'customer support']",be careful you have to download their uplay software the uplay software that comes with the game is out of date and requires that you download from their site but nothing tells you that until you google for it i 'm going to get my money back i don 't want 3rd party crapware on my machine to play a game i wish they put big warnings on games requiring 3rd party software a very big no thank you to that
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'series']",honestly i was giving up on the franchise after the iii but after hearing so much about it from friends i decided to give another chance and i was not disappointed they did something i already knew was comming which is expanding the naval mechanics shown on iii and i have to say it became the soul of this game they did it beautifully one of the top enjoyable mechanichs of all the time for me the story still didnt quite captivated me like the first instalments but i can say for sure that it returned my faith in the series since this time i actually cared about the main character and enjoyed some of his life lessons and how things turned out the dlcs story wise are extremely short but the freedom cry was the best giving an good arc to an overlooked character the costume ones as expected give a little flavor but thats it the multiplayer ends up beeing the same thing as previous games but something extra to try and keep it fresh but i feel kinda saturated with it so in the end this was an game resparked my interest in the series so if you are having doubts about the series aswell i suggest you give it a chance
['no topic'],vary nice open world game tons to do in it

"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'music']",it 's a pirate 's life for me the best parts of assassin 's creed 3 turned into a whole game everything is fun from sailing your ship to harpooning whales to exploring islands combat 's the same as it 's been for the last few games with some old classic gadgets as well and the sea shanties holy crap the sea shanties worth it for them alone
"['no topic', 'customer support']","no no and no this is a good game (not great not excellent just good nothing more i don ’t argue with that but the disregard attitude of ubisoft just amazing now you can 't buy the game separately from the dlc 's. now you can only take everything at once for the maximum price but not only is the description lying and you (for example do not receive the 'cry of freedom add -on, although it is indicated in the description you will either not receive other add -ons, or you will spend several days to understand the problem and activate them of course all ubisoft games should work through their launcher and there would be no problems if this launcher was working an absolutely broken buggy lagging piece of code that regularly kicks you out of your account ignores the checkmark of a trusted device throws 10 messages on mail with a confirmation code and disables dlc 's. the dlc 's are shown as purchased but they are just not in the game and they cannot be activated in any way there is only one key now the golden edition hey ubi you are not paid money to wait for a support response for several days so that they give a formulaic answer that does not clarify anything if they answer you at all but ubisoft try to pretend that they care about these problems so under many negative reviews you can find a stereotyped message stating that the campaigns are sooo sorry and offering to contact support which most likely will not answer you or will not help don 't believe this nonsense ubisoft doesn 't care about you your money is another matter this is interesting to them don 't buy it don 't sponsor their hack and devil -may-care attitude again that 's a good game but chance that you can play in all content in that without tonnes of problems too little refund"
"['pirate theme', 'combat']",bang bang goes ships many ships many cannons many wins find a manowar at level 1 you can do it
"['assassin theme', 'series']",ส ุดยอดมากครับ เป ็นเกมซี่รี่ย์ assassin 's creed ท ี่แจ๋วมากมาย ค ุ้มค่ากับการ pre แต ่อาวุธน้อยไปหน่อยครับ :v
['series'],still best game fan of the ac franchise
"['errors', 'uplay']",just don 't buy this game because you 'll never able to play it that shitty uplay or whatever it is just refuse your cd code
['series'],nice game played assassins creed rouge and assassins creed unity before the game mechanics are mostly the same but all in all one of my favourite 3rd person games series
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'exploration']",it has a different concept than the rest of the franchise but the gameplay it 's similar to ac iii i 'm not in love the story wasn 't so exciting but it 's an awesome and a diferent aproach sailing ships and all hunting sharks and whales very cool but it lacks some of the mistery and felling from the previous titles but i recommend it definitively looks like pirates of the caribbean ahoy
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'graphics', 'exploration']",assassins creed iv black flag review ahoy m8 ready to sail the caribbean assassins creed iv lets you do just that assassins creed iv is a large step -up from assassins creed iii the naval combat is much improved and sailing around is generally a good time the graphics are beautiful if your gpu can handle it they made huge strides to improve ambient life and vegetation and it really paid off everything is an improvement except one thing i feel like i was cheated out of land battles and exploration on land the 3 cities you get are not enough for my type of exploration another city would have made this game a 9 .9/10 for me having said that i give this game a good 9 /10. solid compelling innovative fresh and most importantly fun
['series'],one of the best assassin 's creed game along with ac2
['errors'],it 's insane that a aaa title by one of the largest companies in gaming is the only title in my library of 600 games which i have literally not gotten to work
"['assassin theme', 'series', 'pirate theme', 'storyline']",i started my assassin 's creed playing with this game and this game is a quintessence of that i wanted from this games series pirates seas oceans boarding ships plantations your own brig and rum masters this game is appealing to books i ’ve read in my life stories of jack london «white jaguar of arkady fiedler «captain blood his odyssey of rafael sabatini and other thanks for this ubisoft
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'assassin theme']",the story is okay and the gameplay on the ground is boring but the ship sections more than make up for it the world is vast seamless and downright beautiful and it 's an absolute joy to explore too bad the assassin parts of the game are so boring but the pirate elements of the game make them bearable i recommend speeding through the story and assassination missions (what few there are to open up the world then spend hours fighting boarding ships and exploring the sandbox
"['optimization', 'uplay']",if you 're at the bottom end of the system requirements you may not be able to run the game but in the modern era you can get a refund so it 's fine the game is good
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",best pirate game best assassin 's creed game
"['customer support', 'cloud mechanics']",loved the game always manage to keep coming back to it however i have lost all of my progress even though my game and progress was saved through ubisoft 's cloud save i really wanted to play this weekend but i do not want to start the game over from the beginning all i want is ubisoft 's servers to actually work for once and let me play my game from where i left off this has happened before and ubisoft support is of no help
"['uplay', 'movement', 'series']",personally i 've never been into the assassins creed games so i 'm admittedly a bit bias however i truly feel that this game has not aged well at all for starters theirs the fact that you have to deal with logging into /creating a ubisoft account which is a huge pain for a single player game secondly most of the controls and general feel of moving around are atrocious i never got super far into this so maybe i missed something but to me this is greatly overrated and you would be better off spending your money on something else
"['assassin theme', 'storyline']",assassins templars pirates ships storms ac bf has everything i would want in an ac game great story and surprisingly a beautiful ending the best
"['storyline', 'optimization']",one of my favourite games of all time i have 100 completed it probably 4 times now twice on ps3 and twice of pc great game to get on sale and runs well for a console port the ships battles are still unmatched by any game
['no topic'],im not pirate enough cuz i bought the game 0 /10
['pirate theme'],black flag 10 /10 :d
"['storyline', 'character', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",must have 10 /10 the storyline is fantastic you get very attached with the characters and the events that unfold the game is very detailed in every way and looks fabulous if your a person who likes to 100 games this is the game for you the campaign along with the things you do roughly add to only 50 -60 percent of the game and the other percent is leveling up your character and your navy collecting all the animus fragments chest and hidden treasures the game overall is a must have the ammount of things to do are endless simply amazing
"['storyline', 'optimization']",when i initially approached assassin 's creed iv black flag i had reservations about the emphasis on ship missions and combat however i was pleasantly surprised to find myself quickly immersed in an enjoyable and engaging experience from the very start the game 's gripping narrative seized my attention as it followed the extraordinary life of edward kenway a pirate who inadvertently finds himself entwined in the secret world of assassins and templars the strength of assassin 's creed iv black flag lies in its captivating story from the opening moments i felt a deep connection to edward and his journey the game masterfully explores themes of friendship and betrayal showcasing the evolution of relationships from camaraderie among pirates to the inevitable conflicts that arise from personal ambitions even when faced with adversaries the game delicately portrays the longing for those once considered friends fostering a profound emotional resonance on a technical level i encountered no issues while playing assassin 's creed iv black flag the game is impeccably optimized offering a smooth and seamless gameplay experience however it is worth noting that a slight disappointment stemmed from the frame rate being capped at 60fps which prevented the game from fully exploiting the potential of higher refresh rate displays as someone progressing through the assassin 's creed series i wholeheartedly recommend assassin 's creed iv black flag to fellow players exploring the franchise despite initial reservations regarding the prominence of ship -based missions the game ultimately delivers a thrilling and captivating adventure it beautifully captures the essence of the pirate era demonstrating ubisoft 's attention to historical detail and narrative craftsmanship in conclusion assassin 's creed iv black flag is a remarkable addition to the series its engrossing storyline impeccable optimization and poignant portrayal of friendships and conflicts make it a must -play for fans and newcomers alike set sail with edward kenway and embark on an unforgettable journey through the treacherous seas where the lines between loyalty and self -interest blur leaving a lasting impact on the heart and mind
['no topic'],there really is nothing quite like it since its release
['storyline'],this game has one of the best ending i ever played
['entertainment value'],i love it
"['pirate theme', 'entertainment value']",have played every single assassin 's creed game till this one and i can say that this game amazes me everybody has wanted to feel how it is to be pirate here you can get an amazing experience 10 /10
"['series', 'movement', 'assassin theme']",i have played every single assassin 's creed game to date and this is by far the best if you are a fan of the assassin 's creed series like parkour or like epic naval warfare this is the game for you
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'uplay']",great pirate game shame there 's ass -assin's creed mechanics story and gameplay holding it down you 'll be having fun then the game asks you to do a boring slow follow missions hide in bushes until you reach objectives and the stupid ubisoft towers if you don 't mind that or can force yourself through that there 's a fun little pirate game in there for you
['no topic'],                                                                               
"['pirate theme', 'combat']",beginning is somewhat slow but once you can start boarding ships the whole experience got 10x better i found them to be very exciting and enjoyed the challenge of taking on way stronger boats than my own
['entertainment value'],the best game ever love it
['no topic'],i thought uit was good but it became repetitive and boring really quick
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'series']",well this type of assassin 's creed game sure is fun missions might get a bit repetitive but ubisoft introduced the naval combat which is very fun as soon as you get the ship you can go anywhere you can altough there are some locations which cant be entered unless you progress with the main mission the story is great it makes you feel like a pirate captain and an assassin at the same time overall the game is great the mission gets repetitive sometime but you get a ship and could battle other ships and become a fucking pirate so its worth it
['no topic'],eat balls
['no topic'],great game absolute dogshit company ubisoft is removing dlc and games and making them unplayable (that's right they 're not just delisting them from the storefront people who paid for these products will no longer be able to access them i will not buy another ubisoft game as long as they continue to make choices like this 0 /10
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",the best ac game literally no contest
['series'],best assassin 's creed ever
"['assassin theme', 'series']",this was probably the last one in the series that actually felt like an assassins creed game and not a rpg
['series'],the mechanics were alilttle off but thats to be expected for the series other then that it was fantastic i love playing it
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",if you are a fan of pirates or assassins i highly recommend this game
['no topic'],9 /10 hey that 's pretty good
"['errors', 'uplay', 'customer support']",the game came with an invalid cd key so i couldn 't even play it workarounds like adding it as a non -steam game also no longer work so i was stuck until they brought more or fixed the issue outright if they fix this within the next few days i 'd be amazed it took them like 20 days to get new cd keys for battlefront ii when that came out [update[ i am amazed key has been activated within 48 hours of purchase and i even got a developer response i 'm taking away that the customer service side of ubisoft seems to be one of the better ones game is good too
"['graphics', 'character', 'series']",after playing other games like the witcher 2 the eleder scrolls iii iv v venetica this is the best game yet i 'm 74 and sort of a geek for my age but enjoy gaming assassin creed iv 's graphics and control of characters is outstanding i only play the single game highly recommend for anyone wanting a seafaring back in the 1700 's buy it the only slight complaint is i have lost the main quest line and have not found it i 'm sure it 's somewhere on one of the islands i haven 't discovered also buy all the dlc 's.
"['storyline', 'entertainment value']",amazing game great story loved the campaign
"['pirate theme', 'storyline']",leave her johnny leave her oh leave her johnny leave her for the voyage is long and the winds don 't blow and it 's time for us to leave her oh the wind was foul and the sea ran high 'leave her johnny leave her she shipped it green and none went by and it 's time for us to leave her
"['series', 'assassin theme', 'uplay']",thumbs up for assassins creed black flag thumbs down to uplay cancer
['no topic'],next stop ninjas
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'entertainment value', 'difficulty']",one of my favorite ac games loves the pirate vibe singing shanties and finding treasure ship upgrades and tons of stuff to do in the world and secrets to find shooting ships sending ships on missions slashing and shooting your way to hoards of gold this game has it all looking for a bit more of a challenge take on a man o war elite and put your sailing skills to the test 10 /10
['no topic'],why does this have to go on sale days after i buy it aaaaaaaaaaghghghgh
['no topic'],veri gud gheim ma frend
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",definitely one of the best assassin 's creed games black flag sticks out to people like me who have played all of the assassin 's creed games and even to those that have only played this one the most unique of all these games it has the best story and gameplay and the graphics even seem preferable to the new assassin 's creed games even without the assassin 's creed part this is probably one of the best naval and pirate themed game
"['difficulty', 'graphics', 'music', 'story', 'price', 'requirements', 'length', 'fun', 'replayability', 'worth buying']",difficulty  my 90 year old grandma could play it  easy  normal  hard  'dark souls graphics  'ms paint  bad  meh  graphics don 't matter in this game  good  beautiful  masterpiece music  bad  not special  good  beautiful story  this game has no story  like playing 'temple runners for the story  it 's there for the people who want it  well written  epic story price  free  underpriced  perfect price  could be cheaper  overpriced  complete waste of money requirements  you can run it on a microwave  average  high end  'nasa' computer length  very short (0 3 hours  short (3 15 hours  average (15 50 hours  long (50 90 hours  extremely long (90 110 hours  no ending fun  i 'd rather watch paint dry  hard to enjoy  repetitive  actually pretty amusing  ride of your life replayability  it 's a one time experience  only for achievements  if you wait a few months / years  definitely  infinitely replayable worth buying  no  wait for sale  yes
['no topic'],boat
"['uplay', 'ubisoft connect']",needs uplay and ubisoft connect everytime you play
"['pirate theme', 'exploration', 'combat', 'entertainment value']",i love this game try it before you die pirates part is one of the best part and hunting whale is so great and destroy legendary ships give you power feel just do it xd 10 /10
"['storyline', 'series', 'entertainment value']",best assassin 's creed game in my opinion would recommend buying it especially on sale for 4 .99euro you will enjoy the story it has to offer 10 /10 xd
"['combat', 'storyline']",never really was a fan of the franchise but this game is very very fun my main gripes with the game though are the combat system a lot of people hate it becaue they feel it 's insanely easy and quite frankly i have to agree combat feels like a chore when you get far enough in the game the cut scenes not all of them just the ones that play after you destroy a ship the ai they might as well not even be there if they 're going to be this stupid apart from that though the game is very fun especially the sea combat would recommend this shit yo
"['storyline', 'combat', 'uplay', 'series', 'graphics', 'movement']",amazing game pros -huge world that rewards exploring -fun ship battles -incredible graphics even in 2017 -familiar 'counter attack combat system -main story missions are varied and fun -fun side activities -you'll be singing sea shanties for years (seriously i still sing them with friends even 4 years later cons requires uplay which is admittedly in 2017 a lot better and more stable than it was when this game came out in 2013 it was downright pitiful back then the story missions are fun but the storyline itself it very hit or miss in places i think most of the assassins creed games suffer this problem parkour can be frustrating some of the areas have a lot of climable objects in tight spaces and you 'll just be trying to run through but you keep climbing on things
"['storyline', 'character', 'pirate theme']",this game is really good maybe one of the best in the franchise edward is an interesting character who developes alot through the game and the naval gameplay is so addicting i highly recommend this game :d
['no topic'],it 's like to play farcry and monkeyisland at the same time
"['pirate theme', 'storyline']",changing my review to say that i absolutely support a game that aims to create an immersive world based on golden age of caribbean piracy as all ac games i 'd wish it wasnt so streamlined and forced and that it would be open to mods
"['full screen', 'uplay', 'errors']",i saw a fix for full -screen issue in community it work 's now i can play it in full -screen. ubisoft do ur job fix the game not destroy it completely incompetent
"['storyline', 'character']",asscreed 4 returns to asscreed 's traditional strategy of providing the player with a murderous himbo with a morally questionable life to relive and it 's great
['pirate theme'],do what you want cuz a pirate is free you are a pirate
['no topic'],its a game that u must have i
"['pirate theme', 'series']",matey this be the game that will make you love ac again including the scurvy
"['uplay', 'assassin theme', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",if you get past the hassles of uplay (awkwardly enough i never had any you get probably the best ac game to date with a full on pirates sim tacked on 10 /10 would get immersed again
['uplay'],the game is great but you have to use this retarded drm uplay from ubisoft which is the most retarded thing ever just because of this i hate ubisoft
['series'],the best assassin 's creed of them all
['no topic'],ubisoft is cancer literally need to sign into an account to uninstall the game literally need to sign into their bloatwear /malware launcher to play their meh games literally had to review them on a game i havent played in years because you can 't review their bullshit on gamepass
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme', 'graphics', 'errors']",only 1 best pirates game on time this game released and the best assassin ’s creed ever created pros only one the best pirates till now great graphic epic sea battles drowning 100 ships will not be boring cons lots of glitch and bug can not free dive only on spot need more assassin ’s creed like this in the future
"['uplay', 'errors']",after 22 hours of gameplay a stupid uplay update decided to delete my save file my friend who purchased this very game and faced the exact same problem warned me of these circumstances yet i bought this game ubisoft 's foolish shenanigans gave him an opportunity to say to me 'i told you so
['pirate theme'],the main reasons for why i liked this game is 1 .pirates
['assassin theme'],an awesome and unique assassin 's creed
"['pirate theme', 'exploration']",have not done this much sailing since wind waker
"['storyline', 'exploration']",assassin's creed 4 black flag  to bring my happy hour longer than any of a series of works even though this made the story is not the most tension in dozens of hours of game i feel nothing from no moment in the game even in the water and let the sea breeze will bring their own whatever place and see what these pirates can get into trouble is a good thing people feel good in addition to not impress people outside of the main story 'assassin's creed 4 black flag the world is full of beautiful places to explore full of wonderful for people to discover secret
"['assassin theme', 'combat', 'character', 'series']",great game think it is really worth your money one of the best assassins creed games by far love the ship fights the chracters and of course the assainating good work on this one ubisoft
"['storyline', 'movement', 'combat', 'series']",i don 't know if i recommend this honestly just read my criticisms and decide for yourself i only played the first and second ac the first was a clumsy mess of a game but very innovative i remember thinking to myself 'can't wait to see what they do next with all issues solved this is going to be the go -to formula for aaa games in the next few years i guess i was right ac 2 did solve all its issues and expanded on the original and this did became the go -to formula for aaa games even to this day then after many years without playing an ac game but playing plenty of sprouts of ac like batman just cause and many others i gave ac another try with black flag heard great things about it so why not i don 't remember exactly how ac 2 felt when playing so my main parameter for comparison comes from batman games and i don 't know if batman really improved on the formula or if this ac took a few steps backwards about free running /climbing. the level /missions' design certainly doesn 't respect the limitations of the system the game makes you chase enemies through narrow streets so you will find yourself climbing a wall that was exactly perpendicular to the direction you were running because you brushed against it then the game makes you stalk people but you can 't rely on this movement scheme will do what you think it should when you are two levels above the guards and want to drop to the second level you might end up doing a somersault with a rolling finale on the guards feet instead the parkour system is actually impressive with glitches here and there like getting stuck at small steps and not finding the occasional edge but it 's the level design that simply doesn 't know what it can do well on the sea there is a similar issue it 's all very fun sailing through storms attacking other ships upgrading etc until the game decides to throw an escort mission oh god an escort mission on a ship what else underwater level slippery ice level (retro references :p) and this is yet another example of mission design that doesn 't seem to respect the mechanics a whole lot sure you can finish this level but not with skill you will play again and again until you know where the ships are coming just like you did for the chase and stalk missions it 's not the kind of level design that makes me happy it feels like a chore does all of this break the game not at all it does make it frustrating about half the time in fact it feels like ac1 all over again i remember feeling exactly like this admiring the potential and wanting to see what comes next in the series only now i 'm not that curious anymore specially after i heard this is the best of the series since ac2
['pirate theme'],aye matey fuckin pirates 10 /10
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'movement', 'exploration', 'animals', 'series']",8 .5/10   you should definitely get this game totally worth the money best ac game basically... easily one of the best games in the series assassins creed iv black flag allows you to explore the caribbean as edward kenway there is plenty of content in the game but the side missions gets a bit repetitive graphics: the graphics are pretty good considering when it came out gameplay: the movement system is alright but sometimes the character climbs the wrong way or jumps the wrong way which is stupid the map is huge and you can choose to do many side activities like hunting animals (on sea and land as well as diving many of the side missions for capturing forts are repetitive and the tailing missions are always stupid overall: overall an amazing game would recommend to anyone especially if you are new to the series
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'movement']",best damn pirate simulator on the market as a pre -completion review i 'm giving this a thumbs up while it 's on the winter sale i 'm that impressed time will tell if it 's as irritating as the other ac games i have 35hrs to beat the main story with minimal exploration plenty of side missions and treasure left to find too for those who are into it still has the anoyying running -and-grab-anything-in-your-way type of gameplay but that 's ass creed for ya
"['pirate theme', 'character', 'movement']",this a mighty fun game it has plenty o game play 'n plenty o thin 's t do i love th mixture o bein an assassin 'n a pirate ye can sink boats free slaves fish fer whales find loot assassinate scallywags 'n so on 'tis mighty fun but th one big problem i 'ave wit th game be command glitches thar 's so much ye can do in th game 'n it seems like th wires get crossed in th process climbin 'n hidin in a hurry can be problematic 'cause o yer controller dull (character) messin up or gettin stuck 'tis mighty mighty frustratin th game be mighty fun it had a frustation as mighty as the first storm you seek to escape from so many problems when it comes t gettin yer character t do wha ye wants when ye wants 'im t 'tis be past doe as the bloody devs found a bloody to fix this buttloada crap i would nigh -on loot a bad review and low stars o 'cause 'tis so frustratin back in the back all in all 'tis a good game to seek yer land -days in
"['storyline', 'character']",i really wanted to love this game i really did but unfortunately i played it and felt incredibly let down having been a fan since the first game and adoring the second i was one of the fans who felt let down by the third game but still enjoyed it for what it was although i cannot forgive the ending which is where i feel my dislike for this game comes from the game mechanics themselves are the best they 've ever been it 's the most fluid and easy to control assassin 's creed so far but the overall story arc no longer interests me anymore i found edwards story to jump and skip all over the place i really didn 't feel like i was experiencing his character grow in significant ways like with previous games and the 'real world story while an interesting idea really didn 't feel fleshed out enough for me the only bits i really enjoyed were the memo 's desmond had recorded for his father overall i 'll keep playing it as from what i 've read i 'm only a few hours from the ending but i shall be more patient when thinking about buying the next installment and it will probably be the first assassin 's creed i don 't preorder
"['storyline', 'combat', 'uplay', 'optimization', 'customer support', 'series', 'graphics', 'movement']","possibly the weakest entry in the series to date the entire story feels arbitrary and half -told, and the 'climax' was far from satisfying leading the end of the game to feel abrupt as if it ended early to accomodate more dlc issues that have dogged the series have only gotten worse with ground combat being the worst i have seen yet i don 't think i 've ever played a game where i felt simultaneously more powerful and incredibly weak but they have managed to somehow pull that off it also bears in my opinion several strong resemblances to far cry 3 while failing to capture any of the uniqueness of that game hunting and scrounging for materials to craft upgrades weird visions where you 're forced to walk really slowly by people from your past as they rage at you taking over enemy forts to give yourself fast travel locations fans of the tedious parts of fc3 will be very happy with this title despite buying the game in steam it plays in ubisoft 's terrible uplay which requires a separate account and tracks achievements separately buying a large pack of dlc here on steam therefore requires manually copy /pasting each individual code over into uplay which is cumbersome and unnecessary my playthrough was also plagued with lost savegames which a quick search shows has been an issue known to ubisoft for several months and has received no attention resulting in the loss of about two dozen hours of playtime despite uplay 's 'always on cloud syncing of savegames i was able to lose entire sessions with no real warning on multiple occasions ubisoft forum denizens offer a workaround for this issue in the form of a batch file to back up your savegames (i did not try this but the fact that ubisoft has failed to resolve this issue several months after a botched launch reflects extremely poorly on their further involvement in the title gone is the ability to recruit new assassins replaced by the ability to create a trading fleet managed in a minigame instead (the less said about this new minigame the better i suppose this is due to the fact that edward isn 't actually an assassin until the end of the game and while he occasionally works with them his ends seem mostly at odds with theirs throughout the game in the plus column this game is gorgeous and there is no way to overstate that every sightline falls on something just beatifully done this game also has some of the great jumping and climbing puzzles that has made the series great and collectibles are very liberally sprinkled all over the place which made for a lot of fun until i lost an entire day of collecting due to a savegame corruption as mentioned above the overall impression i felt while playing was less like i was playing ac4 and more like i was playing a reskinned ac3"
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'pirate theme']",pretty fun whether you follow the story line or just like to explore this game has the feel of skyrim with a dash of pirating
"['music', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",so i knew about the assasin 's creed video games but never really thought much about them or really knew much about them so when i played this game i loved the music gameplay graphics story and everything about it i really recomend this game if your looking for an adventure
"['uplay', 'storyline']",your (uplay) account has been banned for 60 minutes due to failed activation attempts the best 1 hour game intro ever uplay better than steam edit got another 60 minutes ban for inputing my activation code 10 /10 would do it again in another hour
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'series', 'combat', 'character', 'entertainment value']",easily the most enjoyable game in the series black flag ditches the growing tediousness of the altair legacy and instead makes you a virtual game tester for abstergo games it 's a weird premise i know playing the part of a game tester and that 's probably the only part of the game i didn 't really like because it takes away from the immersive and fun narrative of the actual 'game'. i think that pirates and adventure on the high seas is a genre which resonates with a lot of people the idea of commanding your own ship sailing free by your own sense of honor and by your own rules beholden to none this game does its best to explore the liberty and freedom of being a pirate by quickly placing you at the helm of your own (stolen) ship and then getting out of the way and letting you play the game as you like you 're almost immediately free to explore islands take down ships for loot and explore and gather relics and loot the 'story' is there when you want it but you 're generally allowed to do the things pirates do best hungry for some loot play a few games of dice or scour the islands for treasure maps and ill -gotten gains not rough enough for you jump in your ship and take to the waters opening fire on any fools who dare get too close then board them and take what is rightfully yours for hardcore fans of games like pirates gold black flag won 't let you seize ships to add to your navy or give you deep crew customization (though you will be able to gather crew as you go along but it will give you that sense of excitement and action as you swing on a rope across to a burning enemy ship to kill her captain and seize a hold of rum and gold and the templars well let 's just say they 're a part of the story the visuals are equally impressive standing atop a thatch hut at antigua looking over the bay at the turquoise waters for the first time is breathtaking the liveliness of towns with chickens clucking about and people carrying on their business shows the strength of ubisoft 's assassin 's creed franchise which has always shined most in their attention to detail in cities the gameplay while similar to every other assassin 's creed title is somehow more enjoyable and less 'serious' now that you don 't have to play the assassin sure there are assassin jobs but you don 't have to take them and they feel like they 've been tacked on to tie this game to the previous ones which is unnecessary playing the pirate fencing with your foes and using your guns rather than the wristblades brings a whole new experience to the franchise and is a great departure from backstabbing and running there are very few times where you won 't be able to stand your ground in black flag your character is tough and capable of taking and giving punishment i 've fought 6 guys at once before and beat them without a scratch through the clever dodge and follow -through moves you can use black flag is the closest anyone has come to giving the player the experience of being a pirate captain if you love pirates and you don 't have this game get it get it now
"['errors', 'uplay', 'optimization', 'exploration', 'combat', 'series', 'graphics', 'movement', 'entertainment value']",here 's a review that might help ubisoft and uplay is complete bogus after all the hours i put on here 3 /4 done the game my game froze when i ended the task i came back to find that my game had been completely wiped apparently there is a miscommunication when your game syncs to ubisoft servers and it just so happened that the server just overwrote my game awesome this a known bug and i 'm writing this more to make people aware as long as there is uplay this could happen not to mention why does my single player experience even require to be saved to a web server where are those days when things were just saved to the harddrive not here not with uplay the game itself is great travelling the seas is a fantastic feeling as there really is nothing compared to it the fighting is what you 've come to expect from assassin 's creed games smooth and frantic and for the first time in a long time exploration is a real joy to persue and continue long after you 've beaten the main story but as long as i have to go through another server for my single player experience i won 't be bothering to buy another ubisoft game
['pirate theme'],im a mighty pirate :d
['frame rate'],very good game only issue is that its locked at 60fps and cant go any higher
"['series', 'assassin theme']",probably the best assassin 's creed game out of the whole series
['no topic'],this is a great game but for some reason it won't save i've tried everything i can find on the internet until i find a solution my review will stay a thumbs down
"['assassin theme', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'combat', 'pirate theme', 'character', 'series', 'entertainment value']",this is a prime example of the sort of masterpieces ubisoft was capable of making before the past couple years this is easily one of the best assassin 's creed games and possibly one of my favorite games of all time everything about it is good the graphics the animations the story the combat the ship battles and the side activities all have their own things that make it enjoyable even the sailing is fun because of the wind storms and sea shanties edward is also my favorite assassin his character arc is unmatched and despite the game being mainly about pirates he still makes it feel like assassin 's creed at its core i 'd highly recommend this to anybody who enjoys the older games in the series
['no topic'],a lot of hype did not meet expectations meh /10
['pirate theme'],butt pirating for all us butt pirates
['series'],best ac game
"['series', 'assassin theme']",this is still my favorite assassins creed game make more like this
"['entertainment value', 'storyline']",its a fun open world games but a dispointed story
['series'],best assasin 's creed ever
['no topic'],the game is flawless the map is flawless and the gameplay is just awsome
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'graphics', 'exploration', 'character']",assassin 's creed 4 is so very close to being the pirate game i 've always wanted the variation of activities to do kept the game moving along pacing isn 't an issue when the game gives me the freedom to choose often times i 'd spend a few hours sailing the seas harpooning stopping to pick up some lost treasure or liberating ships from their captains to add to my own fleet all between doing the story missions environments have been given plenty of detail and character of their own havana nassau kingston and the island ports all have a unique ambience the ocean where you will likely spend a good amount of time also keeps things interesting with changing weather and wave conditions the water even has a correct appearance when you see the light shining through the wave combat can still have some odd stumbles but the majority of the time it felt smooth weapon variation seems to have taken a backseat in this incarnation dual swords pistols hidden daggers and fists are what you 'll use the most with rope darts making a very late entry i didn 't use the heavy weapons much in the previous games but i had hoped to see some one handed fencing to round out the swashbuckling experience the good player character has personality something ac3 lacked large open world is fun to explore controls feel improved the bad storyline feels disjointed at a few steps along the way the ending wasn 't very satisfying lack of weapon variation
"['storyline', 'assassin theme', 'difficulty']","so full disclosure i 'm an rpg gamer at heart however i have a deep and abiding love for games where ridiculous stuff happens and it ties into real world conspiracies the first few assassin 's creed games were just too one note for me personall ,y which isn 't to say that they were bad this game is pirates of the caribbean but without jack sparrow i 'm not the first person to say that i know but like go in expecting that and a heck of a difficulty curve and you 'll probably enjoy it"
"['pirate theme', 'storyline']",not a big assassins creed fan but i loved ac iv black flag pros: pirates ships and naval battles caribbean landscapes silly characters and better ai compared to ac iii is waaaay better than iii and ac unity :p simple but fun multiplayer cons: lack of story and sidequest still not a good port for non sli gtx 700 's (if you have ps4 buy that version

['no topic'],b o a t
"['customer support', 'uplay', 'series']",uplay has ruined this game for me i constantly lost my game progress even though uplay says it saving i have contacted ubsoft more then once and never got a reply ac was my favorite game series but every morning i am back to where i was the day before i have probably lost total 35 -40 hours of game play wont be buying the next ac game
['no topic'],love the boat play
"['series', 'exploration', 'combat']",its a great game that is a must buy especially if this is your first dip into the assassins creed series it mostly allows you to go where you want without limitations and you dont have to wait till the end game to unlock more powerfull weapons (if you have the money and resources go crazy i also love taking over forts and getting land the only thing i would have liked was if you can take over ships and use them as your own i hate how futile the jackdaw is compared to other ships like i beat many man o wars the least you can do is let me sail one
['no topic'],one of the finest games i 've played beautiful
"['entertainment value', 'graphics', 'combat', 'storyline', 'character', 'uplay']",most fun i 've ever had when playing an assassin 's creed game gorgeous graphics and water physics fun naval combat great sword combat and gripping story from start to finish main character is well developed and the modern sequences are for once fun and meaningful although the main missions are pretty repetitive in terms of gameplay (tailing missions especially there 's enough here to justify it 's full priced purchase especially since you can get it for free on uplay
"['series', 'character', 'movement', 'errors', 'combat', 'optimization', 'pirate theme', 'exploration', 'graphics', 'entertainment value', 'assassin theme']",best asscreed since acii controls are still horrible 6 games in the series character is pretty much all over the place and moves glitchy as hell main missions are still boring but the rest is just great best pirate game i `ve ever played lots of fun neat sea battles lots of upgrades fun treasure hunt so is the multiplayer which is almost like seperate game in scale and presentation quite possibly the best assassin `s creed game
"['storyline', 'movement']",wants to do mission gets stop by a man o war ship to infinity and beyond moral of story always fast travel
"['storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character']",this is definitely the best assassin 's creed game of the bunch ac3 was a very ambitious game while it wasn 't terrible it wasn 't able to complete it 's vision and felt uncomplete this game however completes ac3 's vision of exploration and naval combat edward kenway is a much better protagonist than connor while the setting might not be as interesting and the historical figures not as apparent the story is overall a lot better than ac3 's. definitely worth your money
"['errors', 'uplay', 'customer support']","i recommend you not to buy it because the accounts of steam and ubisoft connect are twisted server connection errors various problems (dlc,ulc not working bcs it is tied to ubisoft internet drm ,jesus) and even ubisoft 's response is a mess"
"['series', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'storyline', 'difficulty', 'stealth', 'graphics']",a triumph i ’ll be honest and say that i ’m basically an ac fanboy before playing black flag i played ac ac ii brotherhood revelations and ac iii hands down ac iv is the best edition to the series yet the sheer amount of content here is incredible comparing favorably to open world games like grand theft auto or prototype the core game is still the same you play a cloaked assassin who systematically eliminates a series of templar targets so ac veterans will find much here that ’s familiar however they ’ll also get naval battles and exploration underwater exploration improved hunting and a crafting and a trading system that actually makes sense i also found the combat system to be much improved over the game ’s predecessors newcomers looking for a fun action -adventure game have come to the right place the story break after ac iii also means they won ’t really be missing anything for not having played the previous games in the series however newcomers be warned what this game is not is a stealth game for that you should try styx or the classic thief games in ac iv you can proudly play as if you ’re the main character in a schwarzenegger movie and (almost) never pay a price for it the game is not perfect the controls can be a bit wonky at times and the game suffers from occasional clipping and bugs such as when your ship disappears still this game is one that ’s worth picking up for both ac veterans and newcomers
['series'],this is a great game easily one of the best if not the best ac games they ’ve made however the online requirement just to play the game is awful especially if you ’re trying to play on your steam deck and don ’t have wi -fi. absolutely ridiculous
['uplay'],ubisoft 's forced launcher for nothing is awful
['no topic'],still loving this after all those years fuck you ubisoft but this one 's still a great game
['series'],you spend a few hours climbing walls and jumping off towers only to find that ubisoft is actually run by the templars
"['storyline', 'exploration', 'optimization', 'graphics']",i didn't believe when i heard that this game would be focused on ship battles something that i hated in assassin's creed iii luckily i was wrong ubisoft delivered an amazing game not just by its story but all of it i always thought that any other game could be better than the second one but they made it it's not just entertaining it has amazing scenarios and many many places to explore another thing that impressed me was the weather system i risk saying that it's the best i've ever seen in a game the only complain i have is about the pc version it's graphically amazing but not well optimized nothing compared to aciii of course anyway thank you ubisoft for making me believe in assassin's creed again
"['errors', 'series', 'graphics', 'movement', 'uplay', 'storyline']",a lot of bugs :( if you are a fan of the series you will enjoy this game unfortunately i had some issues with the game which makes it not recommendable i also played the previous title of the assassins creed series and i like the series a lot still i can 't recommend this game as there are a lot of bugs and although there are really big and famous devloper studios behind this series they just don 't seem to care overall graphics maritime missons (i think all the sailing is fun but i guess the community is divides here the game is very buggy (but at least not as buggy as its predecessor travel distances /times mid /late game sidemissons get boring fast uplay the story (not good not bad but very different to the previous titles
['no topic'],well well well look who came crawling back to steam
"['assassin theme', 'series']",great game possibly one of my favorite assassins creed games so far still a great game even today
['no topic'],50 hours and still sequence 6 and no multiplayer gameplay
['pirate theme'],best pirate game ever
['no topic'],great game love it
"['storyline', 'exploration']",progress can be lost ...and not just the progress of the most recent session but you can find youself back to very near square one beautiful scenery and havana was fun to explore loved the companion app too but no fun if you can 't trust the saves
"['graphics', 'storyline', 'movement']",good things good graphics (2013) huge map great story great performance bad things without fast traveling it takes alot of time to get to the next mission but you can also consider this as a good thing sometimes jumping between places is little buggy but you get used to it summary 9 .5/10
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'movement', 'music']",now i 'm a die hard ac fan for so many years now and well i 've played this game like so many times already it 's a tradition to revisit this every now and again but honestly black flag is still at the very top of the mountain for being the best ac game and pirate game out there such incredible writing satisfying parkour likeable characters beautiful open world amazing naval combat plus the sea shanties alongside that it 's just ticks everything off the list this is genuinely the only ac game where you don 't need to use fast travel because travelling across the open seas while singing sea shanties is so good it 's a shame ubisoft didn 't stick with this formula for the newer ac games in terms of writing and stealth but this truly is a gem and a must play if your new and getting into the franchise
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'combat', 'optimization', 'graphics', 'character', 'uplay', 'series', 'customer support', 'entertainment value']",this game was a birthday gift to myself (though it came out a day after my birthday nov 18 and boy has it been worth it i have never played any of the previous assassin 's creed games but i believe i picked the perfect one to start with i am totally enamored with it the ship to ship combat is easily my favorite part of this game and on many an occasion i have fistpumped with my virtual crew on the successful boarding of a larger spanish or british ship in short this game brings out the pirate in me arr i have run into little to no bugs at all in the game and it runs fine on my system especially with the big screen as my main monitor and the surround sound i am pretty sure the neighbors think i am conquering the block and probably expect me to swing through their windows any minute yelling 'heave to mi hearties i have yet to try the pvp aspect of it as i am not much of a pvp player but i am loving the heck out of the story mode even the parts in the montreal office well designed game well written story highly immersive all of the characters i have encountered thus far have a certain charm to them including the one i am playing captain kenway i have been posting pictures of my adventures on facebook and i may even blog about it in the very near future or at least post some youtube videos hats off to the crew at ubisoft who put this game together as it was just what i needed to scratch my looting and pillaging itch
"['series', 'uplay']",i played this game on xbox years ago but it was 6 dollars and this is literally one of the masterpeices of our generation of all the games to come out during the xb1 and ps4 time period this very well may be the best of the best it is a must play game
"['pirate theme', 'series', 'optimization', 'uplay']",paid $30 for a steam activation of this game on amazon way more fun than aciii being a pirate is great have been having tons of fun in my first ~10 hours of gameplay stay tuned for a better review once i 've actually finished the game but for now totally recommended tons of collectibles as always and bonus points for the voynich manuscript being among them after aciii people probably have a lot of doubts about whether ubisoft montreal blew it again on black flag let me just say that i played a couple hours of aciii before putting it down in disappointment and so far black flag looks like another game i will strive to 100 just like ii brotherhood and revelations don 't let the disappointment of 3 influence your judgement of this game while the game itself is truly great you should be warned while i haven 't experienced the serious technical issues that many claim to have encountered on pc this game does force you to use uplay and its not a secret to anybody that uplay is super -duper-shitty. the game also mysteriously decides to minimize itself every so often if i input too many xbox360 controller commands too quickly
['no topic'],i 've broken more mice from this game than ubisoft have released shitty titles 14 /7 would hold a funeral for my mouse 1 button
['series'],fuck ass creed 3 this is better worth the 60 ass creed brotherhood is still the best
['no topic'],first experience with an ac game i guess i made a great choice and it works perfect with my computer so far so good 9 /10
"['pirate theme', 'graphics', 'entertainment value', 'assassin theme', 'series']",after almost 3 years away from this game i install just for fun to replay some mission but to my big surprise the game have lost my old profile so i was smile from ear to ear when start all over again and man after 4 year since game come gfx still look wonderful and honest i still get that pirate feel and with voice act like matt ryan that is make voice to edward kenway it cant go wrong so if you like pirate game this game for you even if you dont assassin ’s creed game it still feel more like pirate game then a assassin ’s creed game and this for sure the best assassin ’s creed game ubisoft have done
['errors'],a bug ridden game but it 's still good just like skyrim 7 .5/10
"['uplay', 'cloud mechanics']",just turn off cloud saving in uplay and you 're good to go
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme']",the best assassins creed and pirate game ever made but it would be so cool if you could have the chance to get a bigger ship or smaller still i recommend it cause its awesome
['full screen'],they fixed full screen issue now its cool
"['storyline', 'combat', 'assassin theme', 'exploration', 'character', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",dear lord where to start with this behemoth of a game i suppose we could start by addressing that this game is no where near as mind numbing and vomit inducing and its predecessor assassins creed 3 ubisoft has seen there mistakes and absolutely capitalized on the strongest point that ac3 made and that my fellow gamers is navel combat oh yes i was very much impressed with the ship combat of ac3 and what they have brought to the table with ac4 is something i am going to remember for a very long time we join edward kenway the grandfather of ac3 's connor kenway as he makes a name for himself in the caribbean islands in the early 18th century he first leaves england for the new world as a privateer but soon turns to piracy realizing that it is far more profitable what i like most about edward kenway here is they have decided to go back to the witty assassin reminiscent of the young ezio auditore i won 't lie while the story of connor kenway is a sad one he is far too much of a whining bitch and never listens to those with experience even in the end he neglects his mentor achilles although edward is a pirate he has his band of pirate vagabonds to crack jokes with instead of complaining and belittling the man who taught him everything i 'm sure what everyone is most interested in is the focus of the game being on the vast blue and very much alive caribbean sea the ship operates much the same way that a character would in the assassins creeds since the second one in that weapons armor and special ammunition can all be bought of course you must plunder the materials from enemy ships to build said upgrades the ship the jackdaw is commanded by edward and is manned by a crew who actively keeps your ship erm ship shape they will run about tying down masts preparing /cleaning the cannons and yes of course swabbing the poop deck the transition from ship to land in most instances is literally a matter of jumping off your ship and swimming to shore there are a few larger areas and 3 cities that require a load in order to reach aside from those areas the sea is the limit if you see a small island feel free to drop anchor and swim ashore to check for any treasure (which you will find plenty of when on land you can acquire treasure maps that lead you to plunders of gold or plans for new weapons for you to equip and use ship combat is also something to drop your jaw and drool all over once you 'incapacitate' a ship you can pull yours up alongside it and choose to board your crew will then toss over the grappling hooks and pull the ships together once on board you have to complete certain objectives like 'kill 10 crew members or 'kill the captain and even setting off the powder reserves is a fine objective and swift manner of clearing the deck there is forts for you to assault whales and sharks to hunt (don't feel bad they aren 't real and can 't go extinct animals on land to hunt assassin missions and some other side quests i won 't go into too much detail about the fighting mechanic of the game has you with dual cutlasses smoke bombs your hidden blades rope darts a few miscellaneous items and i will say again oh yes four flintlock pistols nothing feels more piratey than swinging over on a rope from your ship to an enemies slashing down the captain with two cutlasses and then blasting away four crewmembers with your pistols the counter attack and sneak attacks are your best weapons as always and now instead of the poison blade we have a poison blow -dart gun extremely useful for knocking an enemy musketeer down or sending a brute into a full blown rage on his comrades the game feels swift and smooth when in combat i could go all day praising this game i really could 10 out of 10 really not lying a full 100 it quickly rose to my top 10 favorite games of all time and i know that anyone seeking a true pirate adventure would fall head over heels in love with this game it has really done proper justice to the pirate theme of movies and games it is an absolute masterpiece and any person could enjoy this game even those not familiar with the series pick this up
"['storyline', 'entertainment value']",every thing is working fine for me no bugs or anything and i really like it i mean really i can sit hours and play and it i love that that it feels like the story will never end haha 8 /10 from me
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'series', 'exploration', 'character', 'entertainment value']",one of the better ac games in recent memory black flag is great fun when doing all the pirate stuff and average when doing the main story missions tailing someone to a spot to kill them eavesdropping on a conversation to learn of a spot to kill them or just killing your target directly seem to be the bread and butter of this series and it 's all a bit stale now none of it takes advantage of their really amazing open world more freedom in mission design would really benefit the next game i love the 'real world narrative in this one as well while the story itself is thin the setup for the next game is really open ended with abstergo entertainment at the helm really creative and man they could do some amazing things with that in the future do all the side stuff and enjoy the open world as a pirate leave the main story missions for last as they are mainly a chore to get through
['no topic'],would like to play this game but ubisoft connect doesn't want me to
"['storyline', 'character', 'entertainment value']",great story great character devolopment great gameplay 9 /10
['entertainment value'],i love this game i rate it between a 9 and 9 .5
['pirate theme'],yo ho ho
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",best ac ever made
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'movement', 'music', 'exploration', 'series', 'graphics', 'cloud mechanics']",why do i recommend this game story mode is decent plundering other ships you can send ships you overtake to your fleet and fight another ships in kenways 's fleet getting money with trading cargo for $r multiplayer is also fun would be better if there were multiplayer ships battles or co -op open world campaing i like the climbing movements which are new not like in ac brotherhood or ac revelations so developers really took some time to improve the game when you are sailing the ship and roam around misterious ocean your crew is singing some pirates shanties which you have to find of course amazing thing is also that you have to work hard to upgrade your ship hunt yourself for hero 's upgrades crafting darts etc when you go and hunt some legendary ships be sure to play some pirates of the caribbean theme music using diving bell to explore underwated world if you are gold thirsty and want a lot of it you can go in the pub and catch some rumors about naval convoys also there are other activities outside the animus where you can hack into your co -workers computers and find out about secrets like bermuda triangle what happend to subject 17 and more that is my opinion about the game i was also reading that people had some problems with save and so on well i did not experianced that and i think it 's fixed
"['exploration', 'pirate theme', 'combat', 'movement', 'series']","one of my personal favorites of the ac genre solely because it 's two things that i love in videogames open -world exploration and pirates this assassin 's creed takes you under the sails of your very own custom ship that lets you engage in rigorous combat (with absolutely fluid controls surprisingly challenging and unique boss fights and plenty of that jungle -gym running around stuff that you 're familiar with when it comes to the assassin 's creed line of games 9 .5/10, and only because it 's got a wee bit o age on it"

['no topic'],juice wrld said that dota 2 cant breth
['errors'],i really wanted to play this game but i can 't. it crashes every time on startup (don't get any error massage i tried almost every fix i could find but nothing works gona refund it i am really disappointed would have loved to play it
['pirate theme'],picked this up on sale as my first ac game i love pirate stuff and i love it mostly for that although i feel like they could have done a lot more awesome things with the pirating things its still a lot of fun esp for the price when its on sale avoid the multiplayer because ubisoft and microtransactions and no freaking sea battles in mp :/.
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'exploration', 'difficulty', 'graphics', 'entertainment value']",one of the most satisfying games i have ever played the story is great the open world imo is amazing there is nothing like the rush of capturing a fort or boarding a ship there are some easy parts in this game and some hard parts the open world is nice there are a lot of places to visit a lot of the missions are repetitive but the beauty of the locations and the time setting really make up for it this game is a gem highly recommend would plunder and kill again
"['errors', 'customer support']",ubisoft sucky once again just no care for being transparent and trying to fix bugs they created by force updating games like ac3 or black flag ubisoft has some really good games just no one there to make sure they get the technical support they need i 'm sure its to keep costs down and trying to get cash grabs from og 's who grew up playing these titles
"['no topic', 'optimization', 'full screen', 'combat', 'stealth', 'frame rate', 'uplay']",this is known as everyone 's favorite ac game it is not playable on pc unfortunately a new update has broken the fullscreen setting and the game is less playable now than it was roughly 2 years ago to get to any actual piracy you have to do 90 minutes of unfun tailing missions hokey in -world exposition and bad stealth levels i had to run the windows 95 compatibility pack for some reason in order to fix a crash at launch after all that i 'm getting 14 frames on a game this old is absurd tried turning off phys -x and dropping everything to low not playable don 't intend to give ubisoft any more of my money
['pirate theme'],v good i like being a pirate
"['pirate theme', 'series', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",greatest pirate game ever made my full playtime was about 40 -50 hours as i decided to pace myself and most of the side quests before finishing it never played an assassins creed game before and this one makes me want to play more of the series as a child i played sid meiers pirates and the developers did as well for sure if you love open world games and the prospect of pirate adventures in the caribbean then this is the game for you worth it either on sale or full price (in fact having got it on sale i felt guilty as it ’s worth more than i paid for it get the gold version as it includes a lot of helpful content
"['pirate theme', 'series']",still my favorite assassin 's creed game ships pirates metal they need to re -release this with the odyssey engine like re :2 and skyblivion
['errors'],i can 't even start game everytime i press play game starts and says ac4bf .exe is not responding
['errors'],spent $20 when it was on sale and it freezes before it even gets to the menu (edit) fixed with help from friendly boi
['no topic'],great
"['storyline', 'combat', 'stealth', 'character', 'series']",absolutely freaking epic not only is the pirate simulation deep and enjoyable the storyline and characters are unforgettable this game is incredibly fun unlike assassin 's creed 3 there are many different types of missions there 's more of an emphasis on stealth and they took the notoriety out of the game they brought back the whores and the soldiers you could hire in ac2 and brought back the kick ass assassination contracts upgrading your ship is half the fun and i found myself striving to unearth all the plans for the epic upgrades if you 're an assassin 's creed fan or a sid meyer 's pirates fan you must pick up this game
['no topic'],would be a good game if there wasnt a need for an external launcher
"['storyline', 'exploration']",the sin of repetitiveness and occassional slightness of the story aside we are looking at a bona -fide romantic epic and titanic piece of action -adventure of perhaps lasting magnitude so don 't tell me you 've got no business sailing these waters

"['storyline', 'series']",you want a history that start with hope followed by ambition maybe greed blood and scars earned through fierce battles friendships and betrayal product of a dream with many different points of view a tale of redemption and learning look no further than ac4 black flag its been a while since i last gave an ac game a perfect score but now after finally playing i understand the love of the players for this one it had all the potential great story great characters and much more in a single game where ezio developed during the course of three games ubisoft did some magic and put all the same amount of effort in only for this and i can say i 've been impressed now to continue the ac marathon 10 /10 will ask my lads for a sea shanty again

"['character', 'series']","edward deserved a whole trilogy or at least a full -sail dilogy so much untold story about one of the most humane character in the whole ubisoft catalogue especially in compare with french nihilistic 'heel', overpolished mary sue egyptian policeman who is just the 9th avenger out of 13 protagonists in the series or ...hell, half -deitys. not that these characters are bad you just playing them while with the ones like edward or ezio you are naturally co -living their lives and their stories i personally thank this game for making me feel like that way"

"['customer support', 'uplay']",hey ubisoft someone earlier posted the issues with the games servers and linked him to a forum about kenways fleet issues that is not the issue that people are currently experiencing that is an issue that has been being “investigated” for i ’ve a year the issue that is currently affecting players just started on friday and as affects all aspects of the game that require connection to ubisoft servers multiplayer dlc kenways fleet and the achievement for sharing the royal convoy with friends https ://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/181013/ac4-black-flag-stuck-on-logging-in-to-ubisoft-server-please-wait-screen-since-24-hours/1?lang=en-us there is a link to the forum about this actual issue which you so conveniently locked for being a “necro” post even when it was only posted on friday night and had almost 100 replies edit the servers are now working hopefully it stays that way
"['errors', 'entertainment value']",so after some tests do not save ur game using the first save slot for what ever bloody reason the 1st save game slot has issues keeping a save game other than that very very very fun game
"['graphics', 'pirate theme']",good game great graphics and alot of fun pirate stuff to do ship batles are very nice simple but fun good for pirate fans and sailors
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'errors']",pros sea battle and can board ship fancy graphic (ii love it story rich the sailors always singing when sailing cons too hard to play this game because too many bug in this game that 's why i hate it
['no topic'],paska ubisoft
['uplay'],why couldn't companies just keep their sh*t on steam do i really need to install a different game clinet just to run one or two games while the rest of my sh*t is on steam uplay needs to be eradicated from planet earth
['optimization'],terrible terrible optimization runs like utter garbage even on a decent to high end pc please whatever you do refrain from buying this game you will only end up kicking urself later trust me
"['pirate theme', 'combat', 'exploration', 'series', 'frame rate', 'storyline']",assassin 's creed iv has been a great and addictive adventure that 's only major shortcoming is when it pulls you out of sailing the high seas during the golden age of piracy and reminds you that is an ac game building upon the naval combat of ac3 black flag delivers the best pirate sims since sid miers (which is high praise there is an incredible satisfaction when black flag puts you on the helm of your ship and lets you loose on to pillage and plunder with the tight combat mechanics of parry and destroy that has become a staple of the ac series i have never been a giant fan of thier free run mechanic but if you like it then it is back with little if any change top all that off with an endless supply of islands and forts to explore and nice micro managing side piece and you will be hard pressed to ever not have somthing to be doing my only major gameplay gripe is the ever present follow quests they were annoyong and tiresome in the previous ones and while ubisoft has done so much good in this ac they still lean to heavy on this tired quest type i haven 't had too many tech problems game runs at 35fps on a modet rig with no big frame rate dips that i could see so take that as you will from lush jungles to the changing waves of the open seas their clearly was a lot of attention to enviroment and i had my breath taken away a few times ac4 does a very good job of revitalizing a series that i felt was getting very stagnent and had lost me a few installments back it 's biggest set back still being the convoluted story of ac with some of it 's outdated follow quest while not perfect i reccomend this game for any and all skallywags that are looking to itch that pirate itch ac4 black flag 4 /5 check out my other reviews and add me
"['uplay', 'errors']",bought it registered to uplay and couldn 't log in so now i 'm ip banned and i can 't play the game money well spent gg uplay
['storyline'],have the most powerful sense named eagle vision still don 't know one of your friend is woman 100 /10 epic story
['customer support'],ubisofts activation servers never seem to work if you buy the game there is a good chance you will not be able to play untill you wait for whenever ubisoft responds to a support ticket
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'exploration']",the best assasin 's creed game i have played and own there is nothing like having a giant ship to deal with issues like giant man of wars or the need for a bit of metal the best way to describe this game would be the story of ac2 with the graphics of ac3 then add the ability to sail around and you have ac4 goty for me i have never spent so much money on any other game in my library and this was 100 worth it
"['storyline', 'graphics']","it 's alright but it 's also very repetitive and has all the annoying quirks you expect from an ac game (takes you out of the game to throatfuck you with 'lore', makes menus unnecesarrily clumsy and agonizingly slow etc etc verdict 5 /10"
['no topic'],yup
"['series', 'exploration', 'graphics']",this is the best assassin 's creed i 've played so far and its still one of my favourite games what i really like about this game is that you have your own ship that you can sail on a big map the map is located in the caribbean sea and the game has lots of irl cities like havana and kingston and everything is set in the early 18th ceuntury if you 're thinking about buying this game don 't hesitate to click that 'add to cart button because a history lesson is waiting for you
"['pirate theme', 'storyline', 'errors', 'combat', 'exploration', 'character', 'uplay', 'series', 'graphics', 'customer support', 'cloud mechanics', 'full screen', 'entertainment value']",i feel this is a large improvement over iii the focus on ship combat /exploration works well i 've personally experienced a few glitches but mostly humourous and nothing game breaking and it feels really solid for a game that came out exactly one year after iii which caused me to have doubts but so far i 'm enjoying it a lot and it 's reminding me of sid meiers pirates at times which is another great pirate game from 2004 though as an assassin game ie when you 're not on your ship the game does feel like a bit of the same old song and dance kill this guy tail that guy and so forth i hope you like tailing missions because there are at a least a dozen or so which can make the story and some side missions drag on longer than desired and the free running can have some issues at times not going where you want it to leading to you running up walls you don 't want to and if you 're unlucky ruining your stealth outside the animus this time around you play in the first person as a silent faceless protagonist who just does what he 's told there 's very little freedom here until later on where you get to interact with other computers and collect sticky notes and in my playthrough i collected all these to no reward as far as i know i didn 't play the multiplayer but i did check out the menus and such which enable you to buy just about any upgrade weapon cosmetic etc for real money as well as in game currency which can lead to a sort of pay to win attitude since you can just buy anything you need with microtransactions overall the game is pretty fun as long as you stay on your boat as on land there is not a lot in the way of new content if anything different at all gameplay wise the world itself is fairly pretty though after a while you may notice some copy pasted structures and landmasses in closing i do recommend this but as a pirate adventure game and not an assassins creed game
"['combat', 'pirate theme']",pros you get to kill alot of people get to mess around with the ships fun to play cons have to farm alot (duh obviously it 's assassin 's creed spoiler alert too many people die
"['full screen', 'uplay']",i cant believe im giving a thumbs down to my favourite game but after an update the game runs only in windowed mode and not in fullscreen the game is good but uplay makes it bad
"['pirate theme', 'assassin theme']",this game should just be called black flag not much of a assassins creed game but is my favorite pirate game
['pirate theme'],yeah baby nice man of war baby stupid ass ship haha funny boat i take boat am pirate boat mine take big boat big big boat with big gun big gun on the big boat man of war is stupid and dumb looooooooooool xddddddd
['no topic'],why i did not get the cd key
"['assassin theme', 'series']",a fantastic game with a long playtime and a perfect continuation of the assassins creed series i totally recommend buying and playing assassins creed iv black flag and the hole series
"['character', 'pirate theme']","+good character (far better charisma than connar kenway +naval battle (feel invigorating sinken some imperial man o war +ultra anarchism creed +nichts ist wahr ,alles ist erlaubt -u cant use ur ship to rain fire on enemy in land .(cannon,mortar deals 0 dmg on land units ,this is somehow not ideal -lacks of erotic scenarios (female npcs is not so attractive ,and a pirate without sexual life 9 .1/10"
"['assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'storyline', 'series']",when you mix pirate with assassin it results will be edward have you ever imagine to play in a game with the bad character i mean the evil one any game makes you play with the good one for example in assassin 's creed brotherhood you play as ezio very good person but in this amazing game you will play with the evil person did you imaigne that to be a captain of your own ship give orders be in a very realistic ship battles search for maps to find treasures very good stoyline new idea for ac series amazing gameplay in my opinion this game are the best ac game ...what you waiting for buy it buy it :d
['storyline'],amazing story and good gameplay
"['storyline', 'graphics', 'assassin theme', 'pirate theme', 'exploration']",i like my games like i like my women saucy and with a good story line i dont require a perfect visual experience but this game provides it anyway much unlike most of the women at my gym but unfortunatly this game is lacking in both my usual prefrences but somehow this girl has shown me that looks and effects can be just as good as personality and nymphomania being a pirate assasin is magical could only be improved by a non consentual sex feature and a complimentary pocket muff (apparently i cant use the other word for cat so if you 'd like to indulge in some leagal piracy that wont raise your one eyed snake but will raise your spirits and lust for adventure this will tickle your disgustingly small pickle or nips if your a girl either way pics or it didnt happen
"['graphics', 'combat', 'assassin theme', 'uplay', 'series', 'optimization', 'frame rate', 'exploration', 'entertainment value']",great graphic beautiful landscape good ship battle experience unique gameplay with previous assassin 's creed game glicthes happen sometime but not affect gameplay much uplay does not give trouble for me like other saying game runs fine (25~40fps) with medium video settings on my acer aspire v15 nitro 2015 10 /10 very huge map with tons of collectibles and side missions enough to keep you busy until next summer sale
['errors'],shaking screen bug made it unplayable too bad i really liked it until i couldnt play it
['series'],2nd best ac
['no topic'],an excellent game
"['storyline', 'pirate theme', 'animals']",just like all assassin creed games you go into it thinking your going to complete everything and collect everything but you give up because its the same thing over and over again but a little harder the more you collect but having the pirate ship (its not a boat to cruise around in while listening to your crewmen sing is fun then you get to harpoon some whales and sharks which is a lot of fun and then you get to pat some dogs and cats and feed some chickens and pigs which in the end won me over to leave a positive review also the sound edwards boots make on the paved ground is so satisfying
"['graphics', 'entertainment value', 'music', 'pirate theme', 'storyline']",excellent graphics excellent game play i love just sailing around listening to the shanties being sung when i finished the main theme in the game it actually brought a tear to my eye as she walked down the plank thank you ubisoft
['no topic'],this is a fantastic game but for ubisoft to continue to list this game with its dlc for sale (the gold edition is still listed as of writing this when they will revoke access to the dlc in two months is morally bankrupt
"['errors', 'combat']",bugs bugs everywhere ship fights are good tho
"['pirate theme', 'storyline']","i can 't bilive how fuking awesome is this game you need to understand that i don 't like assasincreed franchise i despise because of retard gameplay and misions you are a fukin silent assasin that 's why called ''assassin's creed but the game is so idiotic and repetitive nothing silent in this franchises now back to black flag i freaking love it way you ask because ,you say that you hate assassincreed franchise because it haze nothing to do with the franchise beside the stupid movement but otherwise is a fuking pirate game with boat navigation treasure hunt robbed wat boats you found pirates sings and no fuking assasins creed retard story this game is a masterpiece if you like pirates and you want to play a good pirates game besides risen 2"

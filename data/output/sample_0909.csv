0,7,1961,0,1713,2017-12-31 16:37:16,this is a good review about ac black flag and bad review about ac origins (i can 't review ac origins to be perfectly honest i have come back to playing this after a year of not playing simply because i bought ac origins for christmas 2017 and thought it was sh *t. i know a lot of people liked it and i 'm glad they do but i 'll explain why i don 't down below firstly i love the pirating of black flag and being able to have your own crew and ship and physically control it and upgrade it for me that was awesome adding the diving and hunting sea creatures to it just added to that the towns and islands are small so you don 't have to run for an hour to get somewhere there is fast travel of course but going to your ship to go places was always more fun and you would come across random dynamic things i don 't find anything a grind the whole game is awesome to give a small review of ac orgins as well (purely because i got it on uplay and can 't give a review on steam it 's quite fun but i feel the developers concentrated so much on the little things that they forgot about the main stuff for example the small things like wandering in the desert for too long you 'll start to hallucinate that 's quite funny very clever and pretty cool but a small part of the game your hawk which you control is again freaking awesome you fully control him and sometimes i prefer to just fly and be the hawk rather than the main character (which probably isn 't good :s...). the places are beautiful well constructed really detailed and awesome for example going to alexandria which is gorgeous and seeing the pyramids of giza in the distance and knowing you can run there and actually visit them is insanely cool i know most open world games you can do that on these days but it 's ancient egypt and visaully stunning the story line is pretty cool too even though i 've only done about 35 of it because i got bored really quickly quite grindy though and it seems quite slow going taking over forts stealthily is really cool too i love stealth games and have loved every ac game unfortunately i found the quests super grindy and repeatable and running from place to place got so dull really quickly which is a shame considering i found the opposite on black flag the worst part of all which is what ruined the game for me is the combat in ac games the combat is the core of it it 's about assassinations and combat now the assassinations are fine because they haven 't changed that at all but the combat oh boy at first i thought it was really cool because it was so much faster than previous games it was no longer wait for someone to attack counter them kill them wait for next person to attack and so on you could flurry your sword or dual swords or polearm in quick succession without having to wait for your enemy to act it was cool and it still is sort of (the choice of weapons is cool as well if you 're 1 v 1 you click in the thumbstick to lock onto your enemy and fight them simple but if there 's more than one person which there is probably 90 of the time then you 're screwed let me give you an example there 's 6 people around you you lock onto the enemy in front of you then if the guy behind you attacks you have to click your thumbstick to the right /left as many times as it takes to get to that person in this situation 3 or 4 clicks now to click then let the thumbstick go back to the neutral position and then click again and to do that 3 or 4 times well you know where i 'm heading with this the guy attacked and hit you about an hour ago it 's impossible and incredibly frustrating instead the only alternative is to not lock on at all and when someone attacks from behind you just block randomly or turn and swing blindly behind you hoping you hit /block them before they hit you it 's madness and as i said before it 's combat which is the core of the game now (almost) everything else is cool but this was such a deal breaker for me,2018-01-12 22:45:10,True,0,0,0.4744525551795959,0,True,False,False

1134,3,2215,0,1411,2014-01-05 16:55:47,"after a short wait with ubisoft increasing the assassin 's creed model to one game every holiday season assassin 's creed iv black flag comes out the gates as one of the strongest ac games released since the original dropped back in 2006 i 'll keep my review short as i don 't believe words can replicate or convey my feelings and opinions about this game adequately gameplay without a doubt the strongest and weakest of the franchise thus far the variety in naval land and underwater allows the player to never feel as if they 're repeating the same thing over and over which was a major downfall of assassin 's creed 3 and the weakest entry of the series thus far ubisoft could very well have taken out templars and assassin 's, renamed the game pirates and it would stood on it 's own as a solid ip from ubisoft with that being said having black flag considered an entry in the ac franchise harms a few things swordplay is still pitiful in terms of complexity and effort with the same mindless mashing of x to slaughter endless hordes of templars being intact once again collecting is a tad bit more tedious now but this is something to expect from a game that is next -gen along with being on sea as well as land controls black flag is going to be marked as the buggiest and most frustrating ac game so far ubisoft has yet to figure out how to polish the climbing of this game back to how effective it was in ac2 automating the climbing makes navigating ships more difficult than it was in ac3 (which was already a buggy mess on it 's own and the increased number of actual ledges ropes and trees to climb only amplifies how painful it is to navigate on land and sea effectively but if we turn our eyes towards ship and sea controls this is a gigantic step forward from ac3 the expanded arsenal that edward has available at his disposal along with the seamless selection of weapons makes naval combat a matter of quick thinking and timing rather than jumping through a thousand control hoops i never had to think about which weapon i was using only to gage where my ship was relative to the target and i instantly knew what i had to use and how to use it ubisoft also expanded ship controls beyond combat adding in a travel speed that allows a more relaxing cinematic perspective while sailing the high seas alone on top of this designating one button to dock release and board makes it simple to understand what you want to do at any time story while black flag will never hold a candle to how tighly wound ezio 's initial storyline was in ac2 or the simplicity that we had in ac1 edward 's tale is cleaner more entertaining and enjoyable than any moment conner 's story ever had to offer before you ever take on the robes of the assassin 's, you can feel haytham 's energy pouring out of edward but with more purpose and context playing edward makes it easy to see why we enjoyed haytham so much and why conner was such a disappointment in comparison the continuation of desmond 's story is hard to care about as black flag has a massive disconnect with desmond for much of the story and leaves us wanting more i do hope ubisoft returns to the idea of a modern day ac entry as desmond 's sequences in ac3 felt more difficult and stressful as you are without the animus ui to guide you you like desmond had to adapt to the enviroment and think on your feet instead of being given indicators and waypoints overall if you were worried about black flag after how disasterous ac3 was like myself do not fret black flag is easily the best entry since assassin 's creed 2 and serves to allow ubisoft to go in different directions with a new ip using the naval gameplay of black flag along with pushing us closer to more modern day entries in the franchise edward is what we 've always wanted from an ac protagonist full of character rich with dialogue and meaning and complexity that allows you to believe that what edward is doing is what he wants to do instead of being shoved into his role like conner and ezio gameplay 9 /10 controls 7 /10 story 7 .5/10 overall 8 .25",2013-12-27 20:02:20,True,4,1,0.5588235259056091,0,False,False,False

0,1,8876,0,2313,2018-10-28 15:57:51,so i have played this game allot and i want to do a deep review into the game i am going to do this in sections so here we go settings this game does a good job maybe some gamers may see it quite minimal but it is simply laid out and is good enough for most gamers the sound is simple and has an option to turn off the shanties so thats nice of course there are key bindings which are now an essential for almost every pc game making it a great settings menu story i am not going to give any spoilers because it has a very good story there are many heart throbs in the story and can make you hysterically sad but if you were here for an assassin 's creed game you may be terribly disappointed this game is a brilliant pirate game with assassin 's creed on the side so it 's a great story but not really an assassin 's creed story gameplay the gameplay is not to hard and extremely satisfying for some fans of the franchise the combat may be a little easy for you but the brutal kills are so satisfying the parkour is as smooth as ever and sort of reminds me of assassin 's creed 2 's parkour but on pc leaps of faith are not as smooth as you would get with a controller the sailing and naval combat were introduced in this game and they nailed it it 's a joy to sail through the sea and attack navy ships fans of the stealth will not be disappointed it has the wonderful hiding in brush and taking cover behind walls also the classics hay boxes are still in the game the free roam is stunning conquering naval forts reveals the huge map giving you an advantage in finding locations another great feature is the naval contracts and assassination contracts which will give you a nice reward for completing them as you can see i am humbled by it multiplayer i hate to say this but i feel the multiplayer is stale and a waist of time firstly it is very hard to find a game secondly the only rellevant gamemode there is is killing your target before someone else kills you as you can see i don 't have much to say about this dlc sadly the downloadable content felt sloppy and the developer 's really let me down on this i am yet to play assassin 's creed liberation but it is more of a separate game i have played assassin 's creed freedom cry and got bored of freeing slaves the whole game this gameplay was very stale i 'm sad about this because they gave us a great open world but they didn 't use this world to it 's fullest conclusion i beleive this is a brilliant base game the dlc and multiplayer were lacking but the other aspects of the game are brilliant and can 't want for the develepors of this game to release assassin 's creed empire and that 's why i am giving this game a 90 /100. rating 90 /100,2017-03-09 15:07:45,True,3,0,0.5276073217391967,0,True,False,False

off his hood it 's a pirate material would you like to be a buddy for my jackdaw i just saw his outfit clearly he didn 't wear a captain 's hat but covered the upper half of his face with a hood although his beard was shaky his blonde hair was meticulously combed and his clothes were not as easy to move as other pirates but more like a long robe leather armor protected his chest wrists and shoulders and his wrists looked particularly thick his chest was like the legendary pirate 's black beard hanging four handguns my name is edward ""he continued it 's not edward teach it 's edward kenway from now on i 'll be your captain this may be my chance to avenge myself i will follow him to the sea and find that group of disloyal and unjust pirates captain kenway is completely different from the pirates i have seen he seems very indifferent to money and the money and goods from the robbery are distributed to us he is always staring at a map he is even more terrifying than ordinary pirates i have never seen more than a dozen pirates that the british people cannot deal with sometimes with just a gentle punch the british sailor falls down in pain and blood he is no different from ordinary pirates and he will not let go of the ships in his sight whether navy merchants or bounty hunters he is very different from other pirates never passing by and always looking east he often talks about ""the wealth that cannot be spent in a lifetime listening to chief officer advall saying that it is a place called the ""observatory"", where captain kenway has been longing for the treasure since he set sail on a very ordinary day the jackdaw stayed near cape guarico and the caribbean sun was still scorching mixed with the salty taste of the sea making me feel dull and suffocating i was dozing off on the deck of the jackdaw when the first mate suddenly shouted ""yang fan set sail but i didn 't see captain kenway so the jackdaw departed and no one knew where captain kenway had gone except for advall the jackdaw set sail again and in half a year we sailed across the caribbean sea i met legendary captains from all walks of life snatched various gold and silver treasures told women my adventure stories used my fists to teach gangsters a lesson and even found a group of disloyal and unjust pirates personally cutting off their captains heads but i still haven 't seen captain kenway but he wouldn 't just disappear on the sea like this even if blackbeard died he wouldn 't die because it was real so he appeared and six months later on another scorching day i met him at anne 's tavern i watched him and anne walk from the tavern to the beach from a distance on the deck and chief officer advall walked towards them from the ship hugging captain kenway although i couldn 't hear their conversation clearly but there is a sentence that i am deeply impressed with and still cannot understand everything is empty all actions are allowed from that day on advall left the jackdaw and anne became the new mate i still live the days of burning killing and looting but the captain seems to have become less greedy when he talks about the observation post his eyes also change no longer yearning for endless wealth his eyes seem to see other things that have surpassed the understanding of pirates i have completed my revenge but i want to know what he is longing for on this day we arrived at cape guarico again with the scorching sun shining on the deck of the jackdaw the salty taste of the sea became even stronger as if it would reappear some day six months ago but this time the captain came out covered in blood and without treasure but he revealed joy that i had never seen before let 's go home and invite everyone to drink this is the coldest banquet we have ever had and the big pirates are not here annie is singing and captain kenway is toasting to the empty seats reserved for the captains as if they are all there he burst into tears but he had never laughed so happily before this scene makes me feel very sad but i don 't understand whether the captain is crying or laughing a sailor rushed from the dock and whispered a few words in the captain 's ear the captain widened his eyes and looked at him even rum fell to the ground the wind stopped and anne 's singing stopped abruptly the crew watched the captain as if the world had stopped moving forward after a while the captain casually wiped his face and fumbled for something he took off his pistol took off his double knives took off his never taken off wrist guard pursed his golden hair and quickly walked towards the dock annie also chased after him by the time we arrived at the dock he had already squatted on the shore holding a few fresh wild flowers in his hand and a little girl stood in front of him i saw the captain so humble for the first time and finally understood what the east he was looking at was since that day the jackdaw has become a legend in the caribbean and no one has ever seen edward kenway and his beloved jackdaw again i am very happy i am a pirate under edward kenway",2019-08-27 17:27:59,True,3,0,0.56521737575531,0,True,False,False

wise but it 's just technical unplayable this is inexcusable for any kind of game but it 's really embarrassing for a triple a gaming studio the main positives are the unique setting the stealth combat and the exploration by climbing and the freedom between naval and common gameplay the main negatives are a flat story mostly flat main characters ,a flat protagonist very repetitive and buggy open combat various technical game breaking issues ,which you cant fix because there is no mod support and a very flat character individualization to see everything in this game you will need almost one hundred hours that 's solid at least [h1]the story (-)[/h1] the story is about a man who leaves his girlfriend to become a pirate his dream is to get rich and come back with a lot of wealth he will become quickly the captain of an own ship the maine protagonist will meet the templars and the assassins aswell he is not interested in the conflict but he will get thrown into it meanwhile the story outside the animus is without desmond miles outside the animus you are an unknown character and you are back in the hands of abstergo industries [h2]the writing (-|1/4)[/h2] i mentioned already that the story is flat that 's totally true and not very surprising if you played assassin 's creed before still at least i had an emotional connection to ezio auditore da firenze and connor or ratonhnhaké :ton. i can 't say that about edward kenway this dude is not very charismatic and i couldn 't get warm for him at any time in the game the other main characters are better especially the villains but before you build up an emotional binding they won 't be relevant anymore the story is not very present and not very long if you could just stick to it the story of the assassins and the templars is even more flat and really not motivating overall you can say the story is one of the worst aspects of the game the story about aveline ist so flat that almost forgot that i played it there is one exklusion though there are outside the animus very well written audio logs of completely unknown characters besides desmond miles they were by far the best story moments in the game and that says a lot [h2]the replayability (-|1/4)[/h2] well to be honest there is no reason to play this game again like in assassin 's creed chapters before you can replay missions to gain one 100 percent synchronization but other than that there 's nothing to discover here besides that there is no reason to play the game after you have done all missions and found all collectibles other games are handling this way better and this aspect of the game is one of the worst overall [h1]the gameplay (+)[/h1] well well the gameplay is the best aspect of the game even though the gameplay is pretty much defined by ups and downs the gameplay is mostly combat split up in naval combat and individual combat on land the rest is exploration divided in naval exploration with the freedom to leave your ship at any time to explore an island and get back to the ship in one flow that is really nice and the exploration is shaped besides the naval gameplay of course with the typical assassin 's creed climbing /parqour mechanics [h2]the combat (+-|2/4)[/h2] alright let 's get to it not gonna lie for me this was the worst open combat in an assassin 's creed game i have ever seen to this point i must admit that i have not played a more recent one than black flag but the other parts before this game everything with ezio auditore da firenze and assassin 's creed iii was way better in terms of open combat well it will be probably not surprising that the open combat is repetitive this was already an issue in the games before but here it really evolved to the low point the reason for that is that you dont have an ability to storage different basic weapon types in fact you can only keep your double swords pistols the admittedly great blowing pipe and throwing knifes this is very unpleasant already for a game which main gameplay is still the combat but you can 't even use half of the tools because you are always out of ammo on the other side is naval combat very refreshing and mostly fun if it wouldn 't be so easy i made it to the end game with no upgrades on most ship weapons it was no problem for me to take on three ships which are stronger than me even without using the mortars in front of the ship and without using heavy cannon shots i would wish more balance i would wish that my ship could deal with more incoming damage and on the other side i think the enemy ships are too fragile the boarding is very very bad and very very annoying you are tempted to destroy the ships but you will get the most resources from boarding the problem is that the game doesn 't recognize if you are in a combat and doesn 't recognize the combo hits if your boarding crew breaks your combination streak edward will fail to draw his swords he will fail to not draw his swords when he 's not intended to that makes you mostly in boarding fights busy with equipping and unequipping the weapons the whole time and raising your blood pressure ofcourse besides that the game often doesn 't recognize when you try to dodge or to counter so you get hit even if you made the perfect controls not gonna lie i tried to do the most conflicts in stealth combat the stealth combat is very refreshing and in my opinion quite decent you have to plan your complete walkthrough inside enemy territory you have certain types of enemies who will require different mechanics from you and it can get very intense and you have a lot of opportunities to fool your enemies yeah sometimes the ai could be smarter but i think its decent enough the stealth combat and the naval combat are definitely rescuing the overall combat from a total mess [h2]the exploration (+|3/4)[/h2] the exploration is always a very refreshing experience in assassins creed and very unique the exploration in assassin 's creed is popular for climbing in a parcours system the climbing and parcours system is not totally unique but it 's not very common and assassin 's creed is certainly one of the best examples for this genre i 've always enjoyed to feel the freedom and climb on top of the rooftops and travel through the cities that way that doesn 't change in black flag but it 's definitely an experience not so good like in the other parts before while the system always had some struggles to recognize which way you want to go it was mostly acceptable but this time it 's really annoying edward will fail on several locations to recognize the way you want to go otherwise bugs or animations are destructing the performance significantly besides that the overall exploration experience in assassins creed parts was always kinda flat that doesn 't change too dramatically but at least the locations where you will find the collectables are more ambient new is the treasure hunting which is really good in my opinion and the underwater exploration areas these are refreshing and a good idea but the sharks are very annoying and not well designed in my opinion still the exploration is clearly the best aspect of the game [h1]the perfomance (-)[/h1] well the performance is usually one of the strongest points of ubisoft games but in this case it 's the absolute low point it is literally unplayable and because of that this game is not recommendable",2021-01-14 22:49:26,False,2,1,0.4350461661815643,7,True,False,False

168,6,19312,0,6250,2023-08-02 10:21:57,this is a great game but i can 't recommend this game for starters i am tired of buying a game on steam or another platform then having to download the games stupid launcher i think if you buy the game currently the key they give you won 't even work i was going to try and play the game again recently but after 40 minutes of changing my password then confirming it with a code in my email and my phone like 3 times each i finally make a new password just to have microsoft not save it and i was already to frustrated to notice i have literally an hour of in -game time for the past 2 weeks and that whole hour was resetting my password or trying to get this shitty launcher to work just to have microsoft not remember new password so i 'd have to do it all over again another thing i 'm tired of instead of having to download a new launcher with every stupid game i buy now because every company seems to need it is the filler this great game is bogged down by simple filler shit that is just monotonous crap i have played this game twice both times i have done a few main missions on one game i may have done many missions and have 104 hours out of that 104 i would bet my bank account i probably played 10 hours of story missions during both playthroughs this is a word i don 't care what steam says i have played like 94 hours of meaningless no fun go to 1000 islands and collect the same item 1000 times and 10 hours of story now all big open world games are doing this yet get perfect scores by people tomb raider games batman games everything now i will give credit where credit is due rdr2 has stuff like this like collecting the 45 bones or collecting certain species to mail to them ladies but those quests feel unique they feel different i 'm not spending 40 hours collecting stupid crap i don 't even need because i can 't help myself i can complete collecting the fossils in a couple hours then next thing i know i 'm tracking a vampire then a serial killer etc this is collect 1k chests then however many notes for songs then whatever else top collect each one taking multiple days to top it all off all these open world games also do this shit where you can 't 100 complete say a part of the map or whatever town you 're in you know why because you don 't have the stupid rope bow which you don 't even get until halfway through the game yet they have doors locked behind you needing this stupid rope bow on the 1st stage it 's like the devs taunting me we are going to show you all these things you can 't even collect even if you do find it because adding the mechanic to having to replay towns and missions adds another 30 hours to the game isn 't that fantastic i feel like black flag is a 50 hour game with 10 hours or maybe even less of actually fun story game play how 90 of the population doesn 't see it baffles me and is probably why every other game is doing it now who needs gameplay and story when you can add 80 fluff to your game even if the launcher worked my brain is about to explode just thinking about all of these things do none of you value your time because trust me when you get older and into adulthood time will be a way more precious resource so either the devs think everyone playing is 10 and doesn 't give a shit or they know they are wasting your time and just don 't care maybe the people who funded the game said they needed this many hours of game time and anything short of that everyone is fired all i know is i can 't get past the launcher to even play it but even if i could i would a remember that everything i did i have done twice already or b forget how long these meaningless things actually take for anyone who doesn 't believe me or think i haven 't done it just check my achievements i 'm pretty sure on one of the playthroughs i did literally every side mission and picked everything up just to stop playing because of how sick of it i was then even though all i had to do was story quests i deleted the game it frustrated me so much twice man why am i ocd either way in the end i am glad the launcher didn 't work as it probably saved me from wasting another 50 hours just to get so fed up with the game i delete it again or have an actual aneurysm tldr a 5 -5 game ruined by a shit launcher fluff missions and items to collect just to prolong your game time among other things i just don 't give a crap about anymore to speak on it i am washing my hands of this game and deleting it so it can 't mock me for never completing it p .s. for the people who can 't play it just download the crack when you play a cracked game you can 't use multiplayer mostly anyway anless you download third party app like himashi or whatever that shit was called for minecraft so you syhouldn 't have to sign into their servers as the crack wouldn 't want that to happen anyway either way it should work don 't quote me on this as i am not 100 i just figured i 'd add my 2 cents to hopefully help some people if anyone replies posting about the morale of cracking or anything of the sort i won 't respond i have no morale just like these game companies who literally let you spend $60 dollars on a game they themselves won 't even let you play anymore they sure know how to remove servers but not the game from stores,2022-06-30

738,49,6525,0,6465,2016-01-05 22:54:47,the assassins ’s creed series has always taken us to different historical periods of time with great success we have been witness of events that shaped humanity ’s life and course of history this is something i always liked about these series meeting and talking to important characters the combination of fiction and history make a great combo of storyline and ac black flag is not the exception [h1]story[/h1] our new hero is edward kenway a mere pirate with delusions of greatness and endless treasures so he and his wife won ’t have to work for anyone ever again so he leaves home country and family behind to pursue his dreams acting out of egoism he travels to the caribbean heart and core of the pirates between 1714 and 1726 but this is an especial case edward is not an assassin just a simple man that finds himself in the middle of this war between assassins and templars he doesn ’t care about it money is his final objective though some events will change that small yet significant ones that will make him take sides and support the assassins and finally become one [h1]gameplay[/h1] while gameplay hasn ’t changed that much the stealthy kills and different ways to eliminate your targets tend to be overshadowed by the main protagonist here naval combat it feels so great to engage all sorts of enemy ships the system is quite simple while advancing further in the story and you get to engage new and more powerful ships like schooners frigates and man o wars the latest being the most powerful ships in the game with hundreds of cannons and almost invincible hulls for this your own ship the jackdaw must be improved by buying more cannons and better hull at the same time you can also change its appearance while destroying and boarding enemy ships you gather resources like cloth metal and wood that serve to improve the jackdaw also every time you board a ship you have three options you either repair your own ship decrease the wanted level or you can send the ship to your own fleet this makes the concept of boarding and attacking other vessels exciting and rich pretty satisfying in the case of the fleet you can clear your way to send ships to trade and that way getting money this is some sort of mini -game where you fight enemy ships and at the same time you clear the trading routes making it easier for your fleet to sail in peace it is not strictly necessary to deal in this kind of activity but it is a good way to make easy and fast money (reales). another cool characteristic related to the naval combat is the fact that sometimes enemy fleets like the spaniard and english ships will engage in combat you can either watch them destroy each other or attack one side weakening the ships or just attacking both testing your luck and skills on the other hand the way you kill enemies tailing them and facing multiple foes have not changed that much though some new tools have been introduced like the blowpipe with berserk and sleep darts which make it even stealthier for you to get rid of enemies or just have fun by making them go crazy and fight also using your environment has improved a bit by using trees and foliage for surprise attacks [h1]graphics[/h1] i must say ac4 is one of the most beautiful games in the series it is breathtaking at times full of detail in the sea and under it the cities look great with a lot of vegetation around and the jungle side of the map is awesome the sea is the main protagonist of course we spend most of the time aboard the jackdaw looking for big ships to board and resources so the sea is mostly everywhere and it looks awesome great waves effects storms that affect everyone not just us waterspouts and wild changes in the water make it hard to maneuver at times also the vessels look spectacular every little detail put into the ships characteristics is great you can see the passion the ships were created with splinters holes on the hull the smoke every time you fire the cannons and the sails being affected by the winds top notch graphics as well as every little island or old ruin everything screams details a beautiful game [h1]music and sound [/h1] there is nothing bad to say here the music is brilliant every time you board an enemy ship or when you first touch ground on a new city every song depicting the atmosphere of such activities top notch sound and music the voices are equally great the acting is awesome believable characters great dialogues and accents from the less important npc to the main character such blackbeard hornigold edward kidd pure passion in the voices [h1]the bad [/h1] while other games in this series had minor things that were annoying at times or simply atrocious like camera angles that made it hard to play at times or npc ’s popping up out of nowhere and textures loading when approach to on ac4 there are not that many negative features we have the usual tailing missions which are a bit boring sometimes or the amount of fillers that are thrown into the storyline just for the sake of making the game even longer we can collect animus shards treasures and different shanties scattered all over this big map the thing is that these side activities tend to be fun for a while after 20 hours of gameplay you just forget about them besides this there 're not many bad or negative things worth mentioning i could say the game is bug free for me some insignificant crashes but that was all no problems with performance either [h1]final words [/h1] when everyone was talking bad about the ac series and especially after ac3 everyone fell in love with the new turn of the series this game feels fresh maybe not on the side of storyline and the war between assassins and templars but for gameplay from this turn of events we can see that the series has potential for more interesting historical events throw into the mix with fiction in the beginning you might not feel sympathy for the main character but in time edward builds charisma he is a nice character full of nice lines humor and a personal story that shows a great potential not just because of the piracy theme but because he is part of a series of events of games in the series that occured after his life it was nice to get to know more detail the whole historical background for nassau and the caribbean in that time the post war events the new found colonies like havana kingston and other minor cities what i mean is that we do not just play a game but we can also learn about the time and different conflicts that shaped part of our history ac4 is full of critical and touching moments like the ending the dreams of gold and a free nation for free men away from the tyranny of the crown recommended for fan of the series and even for non -followers
